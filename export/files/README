When specifying a filelist, the script should have thisoverall look:

. /users/beta/export/distribution/r3.1.1/misc/echonl.sh

echo +foo >/dev/tty

echonl "\
file1FromFoo \
file2FromFoo \
... \
fileNFromFoo \
"

where file1FromFoo etc. are the files you want packed for
the "foo" package (paths relative to BETALIB).

In the file-speicfications you can use the following variables:

AST		is either "ast" or "astL"
TARGET		is the name of the platform in lower case (e.g. "sun4")
OBJ		is a pattern maching the object files (e.g. "*.obj" or "*.o")
MACHINETYPE	is the name of the platform in upper case (e.g. "SUN4")


So when specifying the ast files, you would write

.../*.${AST}

instead of e.g.

.../*.ast


And when specifying object files you would write

.../${TARGET}/${OBJ}

instead of e.g. 

.../sun4/*.o


Finally when specifying an executable you would write e.g.

.../${MACHINETYPE}beta

instead of

.../SUN4beta
