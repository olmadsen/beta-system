When specifying a filelist, the script should have this overall look:

. $BETALIB/export/misc/echonl.sh

echo +foo >/dev/tty

echonl "\
file1FromFoo \
file2FromFoo \
... \
fileNFromFoo \
"

where file1FromFoo etc. are the files you want packed for
the "foo" package (paths relative to BETALIB).
REMEMBER the space before '\'.

In the file-specifications you can use the following variables:

AST		is either "ast" or "astL"
TARGET		is the name of the platform in lower case (e.g. "sun4s")
CODEDIR		is the name of directory in which code is placed.
		same as TARGET except on windows, where it is nti/%SDK%
OBJ		is a pattern maching the extention of object files 
                (e.g. "obj" for windows/mac and "*o" for UNIX)
MACHINETYPE	is the name of the platform in upper case (e.g. "SUN4")
BAT		is either empty (for UNIX) or ".bat" (for windows)
EXE		is either empty (for UNIX) or ".exe" (for windows)
BETARUN		betarun version (e.g. v2.9)
COMPILER	compiler version (e.g. v5.2)

So when specifying the ast files, you would write

.../*.${AST}

instead of e.g.

.../*.ast


And when specifying object files you would write

.../${CODEDIR}/*.${OBJ}

instead of e.g. 

.../sun4/*.o


Finally when specifying an executable you would write e.g.

./bin/beta${BAT} \
.../${MACHINETYPE}beta${EXE} \

instead of

./bin/beta \
.../SUN4Sbeta \
