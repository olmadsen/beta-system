# Instructions:

# Go to the directory where the "diskXX" directories reside.
# Run this script as 
#
#      perl e:\beta\bin\admin\copydisks
#
# This will prompt you for the disks, one at a time.
# When through with a set, answer 'y' or 'yes' to copy another.

# Currently, the script is Windows-specific, as I don't know how the files
# should be copied/tar'ed on UNIX'es... Maybe Unix is ftp-only(?)
