(* XSHELL
 * ======
 * 
 * Use this fragment as origin for distributed BETA programs using
 * X libraries. The program should look something like:
 * 
 * ORIGIN 'xshell';
 * [[
 * --- program:descriptor ---
 * shellEnv
 * (# setWindowEnv::< (# do myWindowEnv[] -> theWindowEnv[] #);
 *    myWindowEnv: @motifEnv (# ... #);
 *    shellType::< (# ... #)
 *    ...
 * #)
 * ---]]
 * 
 * The 'setWindowEnv' virtual and 'theWindowEnv' reference are declared in
 * basicsystemenv. 'myWindowEnv' does not have to be a motifenv instance 
 * as long as it is at least an xtenv instance. (awenv, motifenv, xtenv).
 * 
 * The xtenv instance assigned to theWindowEnv is used for scheduling
 * purposes by XsystemEnv to allow BETA coroutines to cooperate with
 * the X event driven user interface. Scheduling starts when the XtMainLoop
 * is entered.
 * 
 * For distribution specific details see e.g. basicshell. *)
