The OSC semantics defines the behaviour of a program
We need to design a suitable debugger for presenting a PE
This involves several layers, with different evnst/actions being shown and the ability to 
hide actions at various levels.

We have designed and implemented an first attempt of such an experimental debugger.
We need experinece with the design ...

TODO
1. Observer snapshot, new, assignment, call
2. Account object with reference to owner
3. Calls stack: 
   - Daddy: bank.transfer(Joe,AccountNo, 500), 
   - Bank: Joe.deposit(500)
   - JoeAccount:  JoePerson.notify(amount)

We may have various stepping levels
        
All:		step   
ObjAlloc:	call 
ObjRtnAlloc:
ActAlloc:
ActRtnAlloc:
enter:
rtnEnter
do:		call
rtnDo
exit       
rtnExit:	call
value
Assign

For BETA there may e.g. be no exit-part or the exit-part may not be
executed. In this case we need to ensure that the color change. 
Perhaps we always execute rtnEvent and just change color, and do not suspend.

We have to check that Step still works with the above changes

We need to clarify what step means
b. We have values and assignments as finer grained units
c. Even method invocations are finer grained than statements

   x:= r.foo(3,s.bar);
   q:= a + b*c;
   r.fisk(s.snorf,w.hest);

d. Is stmt-step meaningful with OSC's? 
   What do we show on the OSC
   - all the actions taking place?
   - just the last one?
   -- if last one:
   --- an assignment
   --- a method return

RTN: 
- we should show a return arrow
- we should be able to see the method returning
- this is the 'lowest' active (from color) activation

Three levels
- Step: all actions
- Call: all method invocations
- Stmt/exp: next stmt/exp
