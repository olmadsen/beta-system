2. Check/fix return values from functions
   One simple vlaue works - check multiple values and ref values
   If values are returned, then RTN should perhaps not retunr this!
4. Handle superpattern
5. Module -> Decl, eliminate ModuleItem (perhaps needed for
   PrettyPrint!?) But should be sub of module or have common super?
6. Virtual patterns - and %if%then, etc
7. Further/FInal bindings
8. Complete checker - 
9. Unite encModule and FindModule
10. Fix PT to handle Arguments for Functional and KeyWord

Problem:
--------
All modules gete executed

For
	compiler myModule
myModule is executed at an arbitray place in between all other modules

The probmle is that modules are static objects that gets executed when
allocated
