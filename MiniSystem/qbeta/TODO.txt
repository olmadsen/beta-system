2. Check/fix return values from functions
   One simple vlaue works - check multiple values and ref values
   If values are returned, then RTN should perhaps not retunr this!
4. Handle superpattern
5. Module -> Decl, eliminate ModuleItem (perhaps needed for
   PrettyPrint!?) But should be sub of module or have common super?
6. Virtual patterns - and %if%then, etc
7. Further/Final bindings
8. Complete checker - 
9. Unite encModule and FindModule
10. Fix PT to handle Arguments for Functional and KeyWord
11. Fix included modules - the current solution is a hack
    Search via %include works
    Direct access of module name, like BLOCK.do does not work
    The current hack, marks BLOCK always, since we check all modules
    Perhaps we should just mark all Decl's that are accessed 
    This might avoid unused code from all modules!?
12. Make load2 replace load
    

Problem:
--------
All modules gete executed

For
	compiler myModule
myModule is executed at an arbitray place in between all other modules

The problem is that modules are static objects that gets executed when
allocated


Inner:
------

msg1:
   x: @integer
   f: @Foo
   inner -- perhaps a label in msg2?
   x:= 12
   f.bar;
   inner
   x:=13

msg2: msg1
   z: @integer
   super -- return to super
   z:= 14
