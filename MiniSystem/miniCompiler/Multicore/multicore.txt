Issues for multicore implementation
-----------------------------------

1. Check all arguments of CreateThread, etc
   HANDLE; etc
2. Handle termination of Beta program with threads - apparently a stop
   is executed when no more instructions to execute in a proggram
3. OBS! Beta code cannot excute concurrently since the betarun is not
   thread-safe. If concurrent thhreads both call AlloI, the effect is
   undefined. And even worse if a GC is started!
4. A solution my be to write the interpreter in C. 
   - The main work may be to implement a GC.
   - And save the byte code in a file-format
   - We may call the C-interpreter from Beta and thus avoid saving the
   bytecode on disk - if this helps?
   - xBeta-run-time routines must still be thread-safe
   - A heap per CPU-thread?
   - What about cross-references between heaps?

BetaVM
-----
1. An instance of the betaVM interpreter must be created for each simulated CPU
2. A new native thread is created for each simulated CPU
3. Each betaVM is attached to a native thread
4. A betaVM has all internal state as local variables
5. Multiple betaVMs may access the same byet code of descriptors
6. And they may access the same objects - synchronization here should be
7. handled by concurrency abstractions
8. All input/output commands (puttext, putint, etc) should be replaced
   since these are not thread-safe - as far as I know


Open issues
-----------
1. What about the interface to the debugger? If we have concurrenct
   betaVMs, they may signal events at the same time. We may thus need at
   queue of events. And the debugger mus read events from this queue.
2. The debugger should then perhaps yun on its own CPU (native thread)
