for some other examples of using Bifrost.

<P> Also you might want to consult the Reference Manual <A
HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-13">[MIA 91-13]</A>, which
contains a thorough survey of the Bifrost Graphics System, including a
complete description of the programming interface.


<P> The design criteria that lead to the current design of Bifrost,
and some implementation details are presented in a thesis <A
HREF="../bibliography/index.html#bifrost92">[Bifrost 92]</A>.

<P> Some of the demos, or one of the programs from the tutorial may be
good starting points to do your own experiments with Bifrost.
