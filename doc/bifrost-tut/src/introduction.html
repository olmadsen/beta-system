<H1>Introduction</H1> 

<P> This manual is a short
tutorial in the use of the Bifrost Graphics System. The
<INX>imaging model</INX> of the Bifrost Graphics System is
based on the <INX>Stencil &amp; Paint</INX> metaphor known
from, e.g., <INX>PostScript</INX>. That is, drawings are
defined by constructing a Stencil, in Bifrost termed a 
<INX>Shape</INX>, describing the outline of the drawing, and
filling it with a <INX>Paint</INX>. A composition of a
Shape and a Paint is known as a <INX>Graphical Object</INX>.
  Graphical Objects can be combined into composite
graphical objects, in Bifrost termed <INX>Picture</INX>s.
 This is the Bifrost abstraction of what is also
known as <INX>Graphics Modelling</INX>.</P> 

<P> A Graphical Object can be drawn on a <INX>Canvas</INX>. The
Canvas is the Bifrost abstraction of the drawing device, and can be,
e.g., a window in a window system. When a Graphical Object is drawn on
a Canvas, the Canvas 'remembers' the Graphical Object by
putting it into a Picture in the Canvas. In a window system this means
that the Graphical Object is automatically redrawn when needed, once
it has been drawn in the Canvas. The position of a Graphical Object in
the list of Graphical Objects in the Canvas Picture determines the
'<INX>stacking order</INX>' of the Graphical
Object in the Canvas, i.e., which objects are below and on top of the
Graphical Object. The Canvas also allows interaction to be performed
on the Graphical Objects, e.g. moving and reshaping as well as
highlighting the Graphical Objects in various ways. Graphical Objects
can even be created interactively in Canvasses. </P>

A pure
<INX>Shape</INX> is composed of two different types of
<INX>Segments</INX>: <INX>LineSegments</INX> and 
<INX>SplineSegments</INX>. LineSegments consist of a begin and an end
point. SplineSegments are used for constructing <INX>curves</INX>.
 They also have a begin and an end point, but in
addition more  <INX>control points</INX> may be
added. Except for the begin and end point, the <INX>spline curve</INX>
 does not go through the control points. Instead
the intermediate control points act as small 'magnets', that
'pull' the curve. For instance, the spline to the right is
composed of three control points in addition to the begin and end
points.</P> 

<P> To avoid some of the tedious work of defining shapes,
Bifrost includes a number of <INX>Predefined Shapes</INX> 
for the most commonly used Graphical Objects. The
Graphical Objects using the Predefined Shapes are termed Predefined
<INX>Graphical Objects</INX>. Besides relieving the user
from the tedious shape defining work, the Predefined Shapes and
Predefined Graphical Objects also allows Bifrost to utilize many of
the devices more effectively, since most devices have predefined
operations for drawing, e.g., ellipses and text. Some of the
Predefined Shapes are <INX>Strokeable Shapes</INX>.
Strokeable Shapes have the property, that when used with a Paint in a
Graphical Object, instead of being filled with the Paint, it can be
stroked, i.e. outlined, using the Paint and a given stroke width.</P>

<P> The <INX>Paint</INX> describes the color or raster to
be pushed through the shape, when the graphical object is displayed on
a Canvas. The paint concept in Bifrost supports any kind of pure
colors, as well as more sophisticated features such as hatching,
tiling, and sampled raster images. These various features of paint can
be described in two main paint concepts: solid color and raster
paint. A <INX>solid color</INX> fills out the entire
shape with one particular color. This concept may be specialized by
allowing a repeated pattern, a <INX>tile</INX>, to be
applied to the Paint, conceptually by only allowing the paint to reach
the canvas where this pattern allows it to. This is a way of obtaining
various <INX>hatching</INX> effects. <INX>Raster paint</INX>
uses a Raster to fill the shape. A <INX>Raster</INX>
is a rectangular grid of pixel values. In order
to use a Raster to fill the Shape it must be specified what to do if
the Raster is too small to fill out the entire shape. Bifrost supports
two approaches in this case: repeating the Raster over and over again,
thus tiling the interior of the Shape with it, or by using a solid
color called a <INX>padding color</INX> to fill out any
parts of the Shape not covered by the Raster, and thus not filled by
the raster image.</P>

<P> This tutorial presents the development of the
graphical interface for a system for designing a subway railroad net
for a city. The requirements for this system are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI> A map of the city must be permanently shown in a window.
<LI> Using a mouse, stations can be added by clicking at the place on the map, where it should be.
<LI> Using the mouse, it must also be possible to connect stations with straight lines, illustrating the rails.
<LI> By grabbing a station with the mouse, it must be possible to move the station and the rails connecting it with other stations. During the movement, feedback must be provided.
</UL>

<P> The presentation will be performed in small steps, so that only a few new major concepts are used in each step. All the programs described in this tutorial can be found on-line in the directory <CODE>~beta/bifrost/tutorial</CODE>. In <A HREF="final.html">Appendix A </A>the final program resulting from the tutorial is shown. In <A HREF="snapshot.html">Appendix B</A> a screen snapshot of the final application can be found.</P>
