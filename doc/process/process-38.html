 For StreamSockets, reading a line of text with the operation getLine or a word with getAtom only works correctly when the line/word becomes available to read as a whole. If a non-empty part of the line/word but not all of it can be read, the operation incorrectly detects an error. A possible workaround is to use get and collect characters in a normal BETA text object, on which getLine and getAtom can be used. <P>
 If the transmitting side always sends lines/words in one go, the problem is unlikely to show up. In this case, if the purpose is non-critical of course, you could try to ignore the problem. <P>
 Outputting operations in streamSocket, such as put, flush and putLine, will not detect a buffer full condition before attempting to transmit data. This means that they may block until the operating system has relieved the full buffer of some of its contents. This usually happens quickly, though. <P>
 Eos on pipes seems to fail on some systems.<P>
 Certain operations take as enter parameter a timeout value, which does not affect the execution of the operation, because timing out makes no sense - the operation is not &ograve;possibly lenghty&oacute;. An example is close of a Socket. <P>
 In portableMultiAddress, members are deleted by identity, i.e. entering a reference to some portablePortAddress in an invocation of the delete operation will delete that exact instance, if present. It would make more sense to delete every portablePortAddress contained by this portableMultiAddress, which specifies the same communication port as the one entered. That is, it would be better if members were deleted by value equality. <P>
 portableMultiAddress ought to have means for iterating through all its members, such as a scan operation. There should also be a way to test for equality and for subset-relations between portablePortAddresses, and between portableMultiAddresses. <P>
 In the fragment commpool, in the pattern communication in binaryConnectionPool, the operation removeSock does not remove the connection denoted by sock as it should. Workaround: Use sock[]-&gt;markAsDead whereever removeSock should have been used. <P>
 The proxy demo is undocumented and probably not quite working<P>
