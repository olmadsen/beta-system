<H3> Error Propagation</H3>
 As mentioned, the error callback patterns are present at three different levels: Concrete error callbacks, operation level error callbacks, and socket level error callbacks.<P>
 The concrete error callbacks provide the greatest level of detail: their names indicate the kind of error condition detected. This makes it possible to treat different errors differently.<P>
 The operation level error callback is executed whenever an error condition is detected during the execution of that operation. In a extending of this kind of error callback, you can adjust the default action for all the concrete error callbacks in this operation. The single socket level error callback is executed whenever any operation detects any error condition. In a extending of this error callback, you can adjust the default action for all concrete and operation level error callbacks.<P>
 The means for adjusting the behaviour is in all cases to execute abort (probably abort(# leave L #)), continue, or fatal, and the semantics of these imperatives are the semantics of the concrete error callbacks.<P>
 Error callback extendings take precedence like this, in ascending order: concrete level, operation level, socket level. This means that the higher level specifies a default, and the more concrete level may override this default by executing continue, abort, or fatal.<P>
