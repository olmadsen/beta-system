<H1> <A NAME=MARKER-9-87></A><A NAME=MARKER-8-88></A>The Demo Files</H1>
 A number of demonstration files are provided in the subdirectory demo<A NAME=MARKER-2-89></A>. They show simple and typical ways to use the process library. <P>
 Because of the <B>process</B> aspect, and because of the nature of inter-process communication, the demo files come in small groups. For some groups, one program will manipulate others. For other groups, one may start a <B>server</B> and some <B>clients</B> and then interact with the clients to initiate communication. In the following, the groups are presented one by one. <P>
