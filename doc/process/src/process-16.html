<H2>The <INX>Fragment commpipe</INX></H2>
 A <INX>pipe</INX> must be initialized with init before usage. Then giving a reference to its readEnd (writeEnd) as enter parameter to redirectFromChannel (redirectToChannel) of a not yet started process object will attach this pipe to another (not yet created) process. If only one end of the pipe is attached to another process, the current process may read from (write to) the other end of the pipe, when the other process has been created.<P>
