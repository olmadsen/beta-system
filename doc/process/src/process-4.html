<H1> Manipulating Processes</H1>
 First, a bit of terminology. A binary file is a diskfile, from which the operating system is able to create a process, which is then called an instance of the binary. A process is a dynamic entity within a computer which has an internal state and may interact with other processes. So there may be more than one process which is instantiated from any given binary file, and these processes are by no means the same thing. Here, each BETA object which is an instance of the pattern process, models one process. If you want to manipulate more than one instantiation of a given binary, use more than one process object.<P>
