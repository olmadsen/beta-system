A socketGenerator is a factory from which instances of streamSocket and of
binarySocket can be obtained, in response to active sockets connecting to
the socketGenerators port.<P>

 Bind must be executed to establish the given port number as an address, to
which active sockets may connect. Executing bind with port=0 establishes a
randomly chosen port number as an address.  The actual port number used may
be read from port. None of the other operations make sense on an unbound
generator.<P>
 As usual, when you are done, execute close on the socketGenerator.<P>

work as with the other socket variants, and the considerations concerning
nonBlockingScope and leaveNBScope are as usual.<P>

<H2><A NAME=HEADING17-2> The patterns of streamgenerator and binarygenerator</A></H2>
 To obtain a streamSocket on the next connection requested, execute
getStreamConnection, and to obtain a binarySocket, execute
getBinaryConnection. Remember to enter a timeout value. When you are done
with the created socket, execute close on it.<P>
