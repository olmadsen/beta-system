<H2>The <INX>Abstract Level</INX></H2>
 The abstract pattern <INX>portableCommAddress</INX> is used to specify the identity of an abstract communication address. The patterns portableMultiAddress and portablePortAddress are its non-abstract specializations.<P>
 Before usage, initialize any specialization of portableCommAddress with init.<P>
 Any portableCommAddress is able to express its value in textual form, by the operation asText. This enables simple and safe migration of an instance of any specialization of portableCommAddress: Translate it into text, send it across the network, write it into a disk file, or whatever, and then reconstruct it as a BETA object from its text value.<P>
 Tell a portableCommAddress what proporties are required of the communications associated with it by entering a protocolSpec object reference. This affects its choice of concrete communication port(s) in subsequent communications.<P>
 To reconstruct a portableCommAddress from its text representation, give it as enter parameter to portableCommAddressFromText, and a corresponding object will be exited. The text is expected to have been produced by some instance of a specialization of portableCommAddress using its asText.<P>
 Problems in this process are reported by invoking parseError. This terminates the application, unless you extend parseError to handle it.<P>
