<H2>The Two <INX>Families of Sockets</INX></H2>
 Basically, the process library supports two families of sockets: stream sockets and binary sockets. Both are implemented using basicsocket.<P>

 A stream socket is suitable for transferring data which is readable for
human beings, such as the data transferred in a UNIX <B>talk</B> session,
or the more formal communication between a mail program and an SMTP mail
server. A streamSocket is a stream, so you may <B>put</B>, <B>get</B>
etc. However, it is also possible to use this kind of socket to transfer
arbitrary binary data, as no conversion or translation is performed. This
may be used to connect to existing services with a known binary protocol.
<P>
 A binary socket is guaranteed to transfer any given block of arbitrary
bytes unmodified, but you must always specify the length of the data block
when sending. To enable cross-platform communication, the headers of the
datablocks are modified internally. The current implementation make
little-endian machines (e.g. machines running Linux or Windows NT) transmit
their package headers in the format used by big-endian machines. It is your
responsebility that the contents of the datablocks are in a format
understood by the receiver.<P>
 In general, you must have a way of choosing either a binary or a stream
variant of a connection to be established, because it is not possible to
change a streamSocket into a binarySocket on the same connection, or vice
versa. And each socket object models one connection, so it is not possible
to use the same socket object for several different connections - use a
fresh object each time instead. For socketGenerators, of course, this
one-shot-restriction does not apply. See below.<P> <!-- TOC -->
