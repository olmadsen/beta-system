<H1> <A NAME=MARKER-9-66></A><A NAME=MARKER-8-67></A>Specification of Connection Requirements</H1>
 The pattern protocolSpec<A NAME=MARKER-2-68></A> is used to package a specification of requirements to a communication transfer. This package is given to a portablePortAddress, which will then use it to choose an appropriate channel. A specification is built with an instance of protocolSpec by setting its cType and rType attributes. For these, choose from the constant values given in the fragment commError.<P>
 The cType value can be any of the constants commProtocol_... and specifies that the chosen channel must be a TCP/UDP/etc. connection or that any kind of connection will do (commProtocol_dontcare).<P>
 The value of rType is any of the constants commRely_dontcare (no requirements), commRely_unreliable (allow all the below mentioned kinds of malfunction) or commRely_reliable (prevent all those malfunctions). Or it is a sum of some of the constants commRely_loss (prevent packet lossage), commRely_dup (prevent packet duplication), commRely_order (prevent packets from arriving out of order), commRely_contents (prevent packets from having corrupt data).<P>
 In reality, the last guarantee is enforced by means of checksums or something similar, so it is only very unlikely that a packet with corrupt data will pass unnoticed, not impossible. Moreover, all the other guarantees depend on having packets with trustworthy (header) contents, so not all combinations make sense.<P>
