<H1>Reading and Printing PDF files</H1>
<HR>

The Manuals for the Mj&oslash;lner System are now available in
PDF format.  A short description of the PDF format is given at the <A
HREF="#PDF">end of this document</A>.

<P>

Adobe is distributing an application called the <A
HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/main.html" TARGET="_top">Adobe
Acrobat Reader</A> which is freely available directly from <A
HREF="http://www.adobe.com/" TARGET="_top">Adobe</A> for most platforms
(incl. Windows, Macintosh, Unix).

<P>

If this application is not currently installed on your system, ask your
systems administrator to <A
HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/readstep.html"
TARGET="_top">download</A> it from Adobe, and install it on your system.
When this is done, you should read the documentation which comes with
the Acrobat software to configure it properly.

<HR>
The following is a short checklist for UNIX users: 

<H2>Configure Your WWW Browser</H2>

In case you use Netscape, you should do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Add the following line to the file called "<CODE>.mime.types</CODE>" located in
your home directory (you might need to create the file):
<PRE>   application/pdf pdf</PRE>
<LI>Add the following line to the file called "<CODE>.mailcap</CODE>" located in
your home directory (you might need to create the file ):
<PRE>  application/pdf; /usr/local/bin/acroread %s</PRE>
On you specific system, "<CODE>acroread</CODE>" might be located elsewhere - check with
your systems administrator.
</OL>
If you do not use Netscape, you might want to consult <A
HREF="http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat/acroweb.html#helper"
TARGET="_top">Acrobat and Helper Applications</A>
     from Adobe for information on how to configure your WWW browser.

<H2>Configure X-Windows</H2>

In order to be able to print pages in the Acrobat Reader you need to
add the following lines to the file called ".Xdefaults" located in your
home directory:
<PRE>  ! Acrobat Reader
  *acroread.lprCommand: /usr/local/bin/lpr
  *acroread.lprStyle: BSD</PRE>
On you specific system, "<CODE>lpr</CODE>" might be located elsewhere - check with
your systems administrator.

<H2>Configure the Acrobat Reader</H2>

Add the following lines to the file called "<CODE>.cshrc</CODE>" (or equivalent) located
in your home directory:
<PRE>
  # For Adobe Acrobat Reader (mime.types, mailcap)
  setenv EXTENSIONMAPS /usr/local/lib
</PRE>

<H2>Restart X-Windows</H2>

To be sure that printing works you need to quit and restart X-Windows. 
(If you do not want to print pages from the manual yet, it may be sufficient
to quit and restart your WWW browser - at least if your use Netscape.)

<H2><A NAME="PDF">What is PDF?</A></H2>
PDF is a file format used to represent a document in a manner independent
of the application software, hardware, and operating system used to create
it. A PDF file contains a PDF document and other supporting data.
<P>
A PDF document contains one or more pages. Each page in the document
may contain any combination of text, graphics, and images in a device- and
resolution-independent format. This is the page description. A PDF
document may also contain information possible only in an electronic
representation, such as hypertext links.
<P>
In addition to a document, a PDF file contains the version of the PDF
specification used in the file and information about the location of important
structures in the file.
<P>
You can get access to different documentation on the PDF format and
the Adobe Acrobat family of products for supporting the PDF format
directly from <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pubs.html" TARGET="_top">Adobe</A>.
