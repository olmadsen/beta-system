<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P> The BETA language is described in 
<A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mmn93">[MMN 93]</A> 
which is the main
reference to BETA.  The BETA book is a tutorial description of BETA.
As of today there is no language definition manual, but one
in preparation.
Short introductions to BETA  may be found in 
<A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#madsen99">[Madsen 99]</A>,
and <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia94-26">[MIA 94-26]</A>. In addition the following documents are available:

<ul>
 <li> A structured context-free  
     <A HREF="../grammars/beta.html">grammar for BETA </A>.
  <li>A summary of 
      <a href="../beta-intro/Terminology.html">BETA Terminology</a>.
  <li> A
       <a href="../beta-intro/Quick-Reference-Card.html">Quick Reference Card</a> for BETA.
</ul>

<P>
This document describes modifications of the BETA language that have
been made since the publication of the BETA book.  These include 
modifications, clarifications as well as extensions:

<ul>
  <li> A number of new basic patterns have been introduced.
  <li> The operations on basic patterns such as integer, char, boolean
and real, and references are further specified.
  <li> Repetition constructors have been introduced.
  <li> Text literals are further specified and extended and support
for UniCode text has been included.
  <li> For imperatives, the type of a general imperative must
be a basic pattern or a reference, a simple if-imperative has been 
introduced, the labeled compound imperative has been eliminated.
There are various restrictions with respect to leave/restart
of patterns. Inserted objects are implemented as dynamic objects.
  <li> Virtual superpatterns are not implemented, but a final pattern
may be used as a superpattern.
  <li> The use of <tt>this(p)[]</tt> for component objects
is specified.
  <li> Low level primitives for bit manipulation.
  <li> Finally there are some changes regarding dynamic denotations,
concurrency, exception handling, structure objects and the fragment system.
</ul>

<P> In the  following, the above mentioned changes will be described
in detail. <B>The reader is assumed to be familiar with <A
