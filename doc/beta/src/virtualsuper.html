<H1>Virtual Patterns and Final Patterns as Superpatterns </H1>

A virtual pattern <b>cannot</b> be used as a super pattern as
shown in the following example:

<BETA>
A::< (# ... #);
B: A(# ... #)
</BETA>
 
<P>Previous version of BETA has supported the use of virtual patterns
as super patterns, but due to efficiency considerations virtual
super patterns are no longer supported.

<P> A virtual pattern that has been <I>final bound</I> may be used as
a superpattern as shown in the following example:

<BETA>
A:: (# ... #); 
B: A(# ... #)
</BETA>

<P>The situation may also occur in a more indirect way: 
<BETA>
graph:
   (# node:< (# ... #);
      nodeList: @list(# element::< node #);
      ...
   #);
</BETA>
<P>    Here the virtual further binding of element in list is <B>not</B> 
allowed, since node is itself virtual. 

<P> The current version of the compiler will allow final binding using
a pattern that is itself virtual. That is, you can do this: 

<BETA>
graph:
  (# node:< (# ... #);
     nodeList: @list(# element:: node #);
     ...
  #);
</BETA>
