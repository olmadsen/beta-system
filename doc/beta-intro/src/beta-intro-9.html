<P> Objects and patterns may be defined as a composition of other objects and patterns. The support for composition includes:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Whole-part composition: an attribute of an object may be a part-object. This makes it possible to describe objects in terms of their physical parts.
<LI> Reference composition: an attribute may be a reference to an object. Reference composition is the basis for modeling arbitrary relations between objects.
<LI> Localization: an attribute of an object may be a (nested) pattern&Ntilde;also known as block-structure. The block-structure makes it easy to create arbitrary nested patterns. This makes it possible for objects to have local patterns used as classes, procedures, etc. Local patterns greatly enhance the modeling capabilities of an object-oriented language.
