<H1> <A NAME="LINK-beta-intro-_Toc403635880"><A NAME=MARKER-9-13></A>Powerful Abstraction Mechanisms</A></H1>
<P> BETA has powerful abstraction mechanisms that provide excellent support for design and implementation, including data definition for persistent data. The powerful abstraction mechanisms greatly enhance reusability of designs and implementations.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-2></A>
<H1> The pattern<A NAME=MARKER-2-15></A></H1>
<P> The abstraction mechanisms include class, procedure, function, coroutine, process, exception and many more, all unified into the ultimate abstraction mechanism: the pattern. In addition to the pattern, BETA has subpattern, virtual pattern and pattern variable. This unification gives a uniform treatment of abstraction mechanisms and a number of new ones. Most object-oriented languages have classes, subclasses and virtual procedures, and some have procedure variables. Since a pattern is a generalization of abstraction mechanisms like class, procedure, function, etc., the notions of subpattern, virtual pattern and pattern variable also apply to these abstraction mechanisms. In addition to the above mentioned abstraction mechanisms, the pattern subsumes notions such as generic package and task type as known from Ada.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-4></A>
<H1> Subpattern</H1>
<P> The subpattern<A NAME=MARKER-2-16></A> covers subclasses as in most other object-oriented languages. In addition, procedures may be organized in a subprocedure hierarchy in the same way as classes may be organized in a subclass hierarchy. Since patterns may also be used to describe functions, coroutines, concurrent processes, and exceptions, these may also be organized in a pattern hierarchy.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-6></A>
<H1> Virtual pattern</H1>
<P> The notion of virtual pattern<A NAME=MARKER-2-17></A> covers virtual procedures as in C++. In addition, virtual patterns cover virtual classes, virtual coroutines, virtual concurrent processes, and virtual exceptions. Virtual classes provide a more general alternative to generic classes as in Eiffel or templates as in C++.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-8></A>
<H1> Pattern variable</H1>
<P> BETA includes the notion of pattern variable<A NAME=MARKER-2-18></A>. This implies that patterns are first class values, that may be passed around as parameters to other patterns. By using pattern variables instead of virtual patterns, it is possible dynamically to change the behavior of an object after its generation. Pattern variables cover procedure variables (i.e. a variable that may be assigned different procedures). Since patterns may be used as classes, it is also possible to have variables that can be assigned classes, etc.</P>
