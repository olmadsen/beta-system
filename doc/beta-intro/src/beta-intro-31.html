<P> The subpattern mechanism combined with the possibility of redefining/extending virtual procedures is widely recognized as a major benefit of object-oriented languages. This mechanism is often called inheritance<A NAME=MARKER-2-177></A> since a subpattern is said to inherit properties (code) from its superpattern. Inheritance makes it easy to define new patterns from other patterns. In practice this has implied that subpatterns are often used for sheer inheritance of code without any concern for the relation between a pattern and its subpatterns in terms of generalization/specialization. The use of multiple inheritance is in most cases justified in inheritance of code and may lead to complicated inheritance structures.</P>
