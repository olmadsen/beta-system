<H1> <A NAME="LINK-beta-intro-_Toc403635900"><A NAME=MARKER-9-147></A>Virtual Procedure Pattern</A></H1>
<P> The attribute computeSalary of pattern employee is an example of a virtual procedure pattern<A NAME=MARKER-2-149></A>. In this example the do-part of the virtual definition in employee is very simple, only consisting of an inner-imperative. The extended definitions of computeSalary in worker and salesman both include the code noOfHours*80 and 0-&gt;totalHours. This code may instead be defined in the definition of computeSalary in employee as shown below:</P>

<P> The extended definitions of computeSalary in worker and salesman have an inner to enable further extensions of computeSalary in subpatterns of worker and salesman.</P>
