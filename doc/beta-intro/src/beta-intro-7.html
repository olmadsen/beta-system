<H1> Class-less objects</H1>
<P> It is possible to describe objects that are not generated as instances of a class pattern, so-called 'class-less objects'. This is in many cases useful when there is only one object of a kind. In most object-oriented languages, it is necessary to define superfluous classes for such objects. In analysis and design, it is absolutely necessary to be able to describe singular objects without having them as instances of classes.</P>
