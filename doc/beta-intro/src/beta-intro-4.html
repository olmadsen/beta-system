<P> BETA is a modern object-oriented language from the Scandinavian school of object-orientation where the first object-oriented language Simula was developed. BETA supports the object-oriented perspective on programming and contains comprehensive facilities for procedural and functional programming. BETA has powerful abstraction mechanisms for supporting identification of objects, classification and composition. BETA is a strongly typed <A NAME=MARKER-2-12></A>language like Simula, Eiffel and C++ with most type checking being carried out at compile-time. It is well known that it is not possible to obtain all type checking at compile time without sacrificing the expressiveness of the language. BETA has an optimum balance between compile-time type checking and run-time type checking.</P>
