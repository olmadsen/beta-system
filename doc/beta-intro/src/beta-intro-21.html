<H1> <A NAME="LINK-beta-intro-_Toc403635895"><A NAME=MARKER-9-121></A>Singular Objects</A></H1>
<P> Often there is only one object of a given type. In most languages it is necessary to make a class and generate a single instance. In BETA it is possible to describe a singular object directly. There is only one president of our company and he may be described as the following singular object:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
president: @employee(# computeSalary::&lt; (# do BIG -&gt;salary #) #)
</PRE>
<P> The declaration president is similar to the declaration of mary. The difference is that in the declaration of mary, a pattern name (worker) describes the objects whereas a complete object description is used to describe the president.</P>
<P> The president object is an example of a singular data object<A NAME=MARKER-2-123></A> corresponding to an instance of a class pattern. It is also possible to describe singular action objects corresponding to an instance of a procedure pattern. Examples of singular action objects are given below.</P>
