<P> BETA is intended for modeling and design as well as implementation. During the design of BETA the development of the underlying conceptual framework has been just as important as the language itself. </P>

<H1> Modeling</H1>
<P> BETA is a language for representing/modeling<A NAME=MARKER-2-37></A> concepts and phenomena from the application domain and for implementing such concepts and phenomena on a computer system. Part of a BETA program describes objects and patterns that represent phenomena and concepts from the application model. This part is said to be representative since BETA elements at this level are meaningful with respect to the application domain. Other parts of a BETA program are non-representative, since they do not correspond to elements of the application domain, but are intended for realizing the model as a computer system.</P>
<P> The BETA language as presented in this introduction is for describing objects and patterns. The objects and patterns constitute the logical structure of a program execution. The physical structure of a program execution is handled by other components of the Mj&oslash;lner System<A NAME=MARKER-2-38></A>. A tutorial on using the this system is given in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia94-24">[MIA 94-24]</A>.</P>
