<P> In BETA, inheritance<A NAME=MARKER-2-33></A> is not only restricted to inheritance from superpatterns. It is also possible to inherit from a part-object. Virtual patterns in the part-object may be redefined to influence the enclosing object. Multiple inheritance is supported through inheritance from multiple part-objects. This gives a much cleaner structure than inheritance from multiple superpatterns.</P>
