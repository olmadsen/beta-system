<H1> Coroutines and concurrency<A NAME=MARKER-2-19></A></H1>
<P> BETA does not only allow for passive objects as in C++ and Eiffel. BETA objects may also act as coroutine<A NAME=MARKER-2-20></A>s, making it possible to model alternating sequential processes and quasi-parallel processes. BETA coroutines may be executed concurrent (non pre-emptive scheduling in current implementation). The basic mechanism for synchronization is semaphores, but high-level abstractions for synchronization and communication, hiding all details about semaphores, are easy to implement, and the standard library includes monitors, and rendezvous. The user may easily define new concurrency abstractions including schedulers for processes.</P>
<P> BETA supports the three main subfunctions of abstraction: identification, classification, and composition as described in the following.</P>
