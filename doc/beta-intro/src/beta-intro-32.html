<H1> Classification and inheritance </H1>
<P> In BETA subpatterns are intended for representing classification<A NAME=MARKER-2-178></A> and inheritance of code is a (useful) side effect. In BETA it is not possible to define a pattern with multiple superpatterns corresponding to multiple inheritance<A NAME=MARKER-2-179></A>. There are indeed cases where it is useful to represent classification hierarchies that are not tree structured. However, a technical solution that justifies the extra complexity has not yet been found.</P>
