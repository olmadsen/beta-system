<H1> Menu Handling</H1>
<P> Lidskjalv offers several facilities for dealing with menus.  In Lidskjalv applications, menus can be of four types, namely pulldown and pop-up menus (and both menu types can be linear or hierarchical), where the linear and hierarchical pulldown menus are the most often used menu types.  Pulldown menus are associated with the menubar that is located in the top of the window (or on the top of the screen on the Macintosh platform).  Each pulldown menu has a title which is shown in the menubar.  When that title is selected with the mouse, the pulldown menu is shown.  </P>

<P> Pop-up menus are under the control of the application programmer, who at any point in the program may specify that a particular menu must be popped up at a specific position (e.g. inside a window).  </P>
