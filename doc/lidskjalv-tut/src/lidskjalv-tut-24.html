<H2> Figure Items</H2>
<P> As described above, the responsibility for the contents of an instance of window relies on the programmer.  To aid the programmer in making graphics, Guienv defines a number of patterns for drawing lines, rectangles (with sharp or round corners), ovals, wedges and polygons.  </P>
<center> <GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=figureitems-hierarchy.gif></center>

<P> FigureItem is a subpattern of windowItem and inherits as such all
its functionality (including the event handling possibilities) and
defines the basic properties that are shared by all figure items.  A
figure item have a pen to be used for drawing the item.  The pen
defines attributes for defining the drawing pattern, the foreground
and background colors, and the size of the pen (a rectangle).</P>

<P> Line is a straight line and defines the attributes start and end
for accessing and changing the end-points of the line.</P>

<P> Shape is used as superpattern to all figure items that are defined
by means of a rectangle and can be filled.   Shape contains a fill
attribute which defines the facilities for filling the shape (i.e. the
tile pattern and the foreground and background colors to be used for
the fill).</P>
