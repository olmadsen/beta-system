<H2> <A NAME="LINK-mia90-02.mif-_Toc401563569"><A NAME=MARKER-9-12></A>1.  Introduction</A></H2>

<P> This manual describes version 5.4 of the BETA compiler
(corresponding to release 5.0 of the Mj&oslash;lner System). The
compiler implements most parts of the BETA language as described in <A
HREF="../bibliography/#mmn93">[MMN93]</A>.

There are, however, some changes that have been made to BETA since
the publication of [MMN93]. These changes are described in:
<ul
  <li><a href=../beta/beta.html>BETA Language Modifications</a>
</ul>


<P> See Appendix C for an overview of new features in v5.4 of the
compiler. The BETA compiler is accompanied by a large collection of
libraries and application frameworks. This includes a text concept,
and libraries for input/output on keyboard, screen and files, a user
interface package, a library of well-known datastructures, and a
metaprogramming system. The Mj&oslash;lner System is available for The
Power Macintosh3.2 or later, UNIX workstations such as Sun-4 (SPARC
running SunOS or Solaris), HP-9000 series 400, 700, Silicon Graphics
running IRIX 5.3, and PC&otilde;s running Windows NT, Windows 95 or
Linux.</P>

<P> On Macintosh the user interface system is implemented on top of
the Macintosh Toolbox. For Macintosh there is also a library that
interfaces directly to the Toolbox. </P>

<P> On UNIX, the user interface system is implemented on top of the X
Window System (X11R3 or later). A number of UNIX facilities can be
accessed via a UNIX library.</P>

<P> On Windows 95 and Windows NT, the user interface system is
implemented on top of WIN32.</P> 

<P> A general interface to C and assembly language is part of the
libraries/compiler. </P> 

<P> The rest of this manual is organized as follows: Section 2
describes the simplest way of using the compiler. Section 3 describes
the organization of the basic BETA libraries. Section 4 describes the
files generated by the compiler.  Section 5 describes compile- and
run-time errors. These sections contain useful information for all
users. </P>

<P> The remaining sections are only for advanced users. In section 6,
a number of different arguments to the compiler are described. In
section 7, it is described how to instantiate machine dependent
configurations of a program. In section 8 it is described how code is
generated for multiple machines.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-11></A>
<H2> 2.  Simple Use of the Compiler</H2>

The following is an example of a very small BETA program.

<H4 class=betacaption>hello.bet</H4>
<PRE class=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/betaenv'
--- PROGRAM: descriptor ---
(#
do 'Welcome to Mjolner' -&gt; putLine
#)
</PRE>

<P> Only the part between <CODE>(# ... #)</CODE> is BETA. The
<CODE>ORIGIN</CODE> specification:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/betaenv'
</PRE>

<P> describes that the fragment <CODE>betaenv</CODE> from the BETA
basic library (basiclib) is used. </P> 

<P> The fragment name and category:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
--- PROGRAM: descriptor ---
</PRE>

<P> describes that the BETA program is filled into a slot in betaenv called PROGRAM. The BETA compiler is integrated with the Mj&oslash;lner fragment system. The above BETA program is an example of a BETA fragment. </P>
<P> Assume that the above BETA fragment is located in the file foo.bet. The BETA fragment may then be compiled by issuing the command </P>

<PRE class=beta>
beta foo.bet
</PRE>

which will compile, assemble<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE
HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></EM>  
and link<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</A></EM> the BETA
fragment. 
The final object code will be in the file foo, which may be executed.  </P>
<P> How to invoke the compiler depends on whether Macintosh, PC or
UNIX is used. Details about the different variants of the BETA
compiler may be found in 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-6">[MIA90-6]</A> for Macintosh, 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-6">[MIA94-32]</A> for Windows,  and in 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-6">[MIA90-4]</A> for UNIX. </P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-28></A>

<H2> 3 The BETA Library</H2> <P> The BETA library is a collection of
patterns and objects that include input/output, a text concept, the
user interface toolkit, the metaprogramming system, a container
library, a system library, etc. The library is organized as
fragments. </P> <P> One part of the library contains the basic
patterns and objects which are used by most programs. This basic BETA
library is called basiclib and is described in 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-8">[MIA90-8]</A>,
which also
describes the interface to C and assembly language. </P> <P> The
library basiclib contains a number of different fragments groups
containing basic patterns, a text concept, various functions and
control patterns, a file concept, etc. One of these fragment groups is
betaenv, which contains the basic patterns, the text concept, other
basic patterns and objects representing the screen and the
keyboard. All BETA programs must use betaenv, which has the form: </P>

<PRE class=beta>
(# ...
   (* A lot of useful patterns *)
   ...
   &lt;&lt;SLOT LIB: attributes&gt;&gt;
   ...
   program: &lt;&lt;SLOT program: descriptor&gt;&gt;
   theProgram: ^|program;
do ...
   &amp;|program[] -&gt; theProgram[];
   theProgram;
   ...
#)
</PRE>

The LIB slot describes where most libraries are inserted. The program
slot describes where an ordinary user program is inserted (see section
6 for more explanation of this). </P> <P> On UNIX, the BETA library is
often located in the directory <CODE>/usr/local/lib/beta</CODE>. </P>
<P> For Macintosh, the convention is that the BETA library is located
in a folder called <CODE>beta</CODE>. </P> <P> In the rest of this
manual, we assume that the basic library is located in
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/beta</CODE>. 

We also use the UNIX convention for denoting
directories with the character <CODE>/</CODE> to separate directory and file
names.</P> 

<P> The Mj&oslash;lner System contains directories for the
various libraries. The basic library basiclib is e.g. located in the
directory: </P>

<pre class=beta> /usr/local/lib/beta/basiclib</PRE>

<P> This directory contains the fragment groups constituting
basiclib. Instead of referring to a specific version, it is possible
to refer to the current official version by means of the name
current. (This is not possible on Windows and Macintosh). </P> <P> The
Mj&oslash;lner System accepts the following abbreviation for the BETA
library:</P> 

<PRE class=beta> ~beta denotes /usr/local/lib/beta</PRE>

<P> The meaning of ~beta can be changed by using the
<CODE>BETALIB</CODE> environment variable, see 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-4">[MIA90-4]</A>.</P>

<P> To sum up, the file containing the current version of betaenv may
be referred to by: </P>

<PRE class=beta> ~beta/basiclib/betaenv</PRE>

<P> A user-program using betaenv may then look as follows:

<H4 class=betacaption>hello.bet</H4>
<PRE class=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/current/betaenv'
--- PROGRAM: descriptor ---
(#
do 'Welcome to Mjolner' -&gt; PutLine
#)
</PRE>


<P> Please note, that on Windows and Macintosh the separator in ORIGIN specifications is also /. See section 6.2.</P>
<P> Assume that the above program resides on the file foo.bet. The program may then be compiled by issuing the command: </P>
<P> </P>

<PRE class=beta> beta foo.bet </PRE>

<P> The file foo will now contain an executable version of foo.bet. </P>
<P> When developing the program,  it may be an advantage to invoke the compiler as</P>
<P> </P>

<PRE class=beta> beta -r foo.bet </PRE>

<P> This will run the compiler in repeating mode. After having
translated the fragments specified in the argument list, if in
repeating mode, the compiler prompts the user for the name of another
fragment to be translated. Hitting &lt;RETURN&gt; in this case will
recompiler the program last compiled. See section 8 for a survey of
the legal command line options.<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE
HREF="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</A></EM></P>

<P> Please consult the BETA tutorial 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-24">[MIA90-24]</A>
 for a quick survey of
the BETA language and the basic libraries.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-75></A>
<H2> 4.  Files Generated by the Compiler<A NAME=MARKER-2-14></A></H2>

<P> For each fragment file, a number of other files may be produced by
the compiler; let foo.bet be a BETA fragment. 
Then </P>
<DL>


<DT><tt>foo.lst </tt>
<DD>contains information about possible syntactic and
static semantic errors. If such errors occur, then the file contains a
pretty-print of the fragment with an indication of the error(s). See
section 7 for further information about error handling. Possible
semantic error messages are listed in appendix A.</P>

<DT><tt>foo.ast or foo.astL</tt>
<DD>contains the abstract syntax tree
representation of the compiled source code for big-endian and
little-endian architectures, respectively. The AST files are used by
many tools in  the Mj&oslash;lner System.</P>

<DT><tt>foo..s </tt>
<DD>contains the generated assembly code for the
compiled source code<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE
HREF="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></EM>. Assembly files are located in
subdirectories named according to the machine type, to which the
source code has been compiled. Currently, the directories  sun4,
sun4s, hpux9mc, hpux9pa, nti, linux, sgi, and ppcmac can be
created. These directories are automatically created by the compiler,
if not present already. The assembly file is usually deleted by the
compiler after assembly.</P>

<DT><TT>foo.o</tt>
<DD> contains the object code generated by the
assembler. Like foo..s, this file is placed in a subdirectory.</P>

<DT><tt>foo.db </tt>
<DD>contains information used by the debugger
Valhalla when debugging the foo fragment. See 
<A HREF="../bibliography/#mia90-12">[MIA90-12]</A>. 
Like
<tt>foo..s</tt>, this file is placed in a subdirectory.</P>

<DT><tt>foo..gs and foo..go </tt>
<DD>are generated instead of foo..s and foo..o if foo is compiled with
debug info on. This is a temporary solution and these files will not
be generated in a future release of the compiler.</P>
</DL>

<P> The above list of files is generated for each fragment group that
is included in a program. In addition, the following two files are
generated for each program:</P>

<DL>

<DT><tt>foo </tt>
<DD>containing the executable code for the program. </P>

<DT><tt>foo..job </tt> <DD>containing directives for assembly and
linking. Like <tt>foo..s</tt>, this file is placed in a
subdirectory. This file is usually deleted by the compiler after
linking.</P>

</DL>

<!---datpete: hereto -->

<P> For some implementations (e.g. Windows NT) other extensions than
..s and .o may be used. </P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1603></A>
<H2> 5.  Error Handling</H2>
<P> BETA programs containing errors will cause error messages during compilation. Error messages may appear during syntax analysis, static semantic analysis, code generation and assembly/linking. In addition various forms of system errors may occur. </P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-1605></A>
<H3> 5.1  Syntax Errors<A NAME=MARKER-2-24></A></H3>
<P> A syntax error is given when there are errors in the context free syntax of the BETA program. These includes missing semicolons, non-matching brackets, etc. Such errors are printed on the screen and may look as follows: </P>

<PRE class=beta>
 Parse errors 
 #   1 ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/betaenv'
 #   2 --PROGRAM: descriptor--
 #   3 (# T: (# #);
 #   4    X: [100) @integer;
 # ************* ^
 #  Expected symbols: &gt;= mod &lt; &lt;= = % &lt;&gt; &gt; -&gt; * ] div +  / 
    xor or and
  File &quot;syntaxerror.bet&quot;; Line 4
 #   3 (# T: (# #);
 #   4    X: [100) @integer;
 #   5 do (for i: X.range repeat
 #   6         3-&gt;X[i];
 #   7    if)
 # ******* ^
 #  Expected symbols: _NAME_ _KONST_ _STRING_ none not @@ 
    restart leave ; (# % &amp; ( this +  inner for tos suspend
  File &quot;syntaxerror.bet&quot;; Line 7
</PRE>

The error message shows that there are syntax errors in lines 4 and
7. In line 4 the arrow(^) points at the place where an illegal symbol
is met. The compiler gives a list of acceptable symbols. In this case
) should have been a ]. In line 7, the if should have been a for. </P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1627></A>
<H3> 5.2  Static Semantic Errors<A NAME=MARKER-2-25></A></H3>


<P> Static semantic errors appear in situations where a name is used
without being declared, where a pattern name is used as an object,
etc. Each error found is printed on the screen with a small indication
of the context. After the checking, a pretty print of the fragment
including a precise indication of the error is generated on the
lst-file (see section 4)<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE
HREF="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</A></EM></P>

<P> In appendix A, the semantic error messages that may be reported by the compiler are listed.  </P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1630></A>
<H3> 5.3 Check for bound SLOTs.</H3>
<P> In general the compiler will only attempt to link, if a PROGRAM slot has been found in the dependency graph. </P>
<P> If SLOTs of category DoPart or Descriptor in the dependency graph are not bound, and linking would otherwise have happened, the compiler issues a warning, and does not attempt to link.</P>
<P> Likewise, if two or more fragments tries to bind the same SLOT, the compiler will give a warning.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1634></A>
<H3> 5.4  Assembler and Linker Errors</H3>
<P> Errors may also appear during assembling and linking. The following type of errors may appear: </P>

<P> &middot; The assembler/linker complains about a corrupt ..s or .o file. This may happen if the compilation/assembly has been interrupted for some reason leaving an incomplete file. This can usually be handled by forcing a recompilation of the corresponding BETA file. (Delete the ..s <I>and</I> .o files in question)</P>

<P> &middot; The linker may report errors such as &quot;Undefined Reference&quot; or &quot;Multiply Defined Symbol&quot;. This may be due to violations of the restrictions mentioned in section 6. </P>
<P> &middot; The disk may run full during assembling or linking. Restart compilation after having obtained more disk space.</P>
<P> See also section 6.6.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1640></A>
<H3> 5.5  System Errors</H3>
<P> Two kinds of system errors may appear: (1) Errors in the compiler, and (2) error situations in the operating systems. Most times a meaningful error message is given in these situations, but due to the nature of these errors this is not always the case.</P>
<P> Compiler errors should be reported to Mj&oslash;lner Informatics ApS. This can be done in one of three ways:</P>
<P> 1. Via electronic mail using the Internet address <BR>support@mjolner.dk </P>
<P> 2. By sending a fax to Mj&oslash;lner Informatics ApS at <BR>+45 86 20 12 22 </P>
<P> 3.  By issuing an ordinary mail to the address<BR>Mj&oslash;lner Informatics<BR>Science Park Aarhus,<BR>Gustav Wieds Vej 10<BR>DK-8000 <BR>Denmark</P>
<P> Operating system errors are often due to local problems. Examples of such errors may be: insufficient access to files, no more disc space, file server inaccessible, etc. </P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1647></A>
<H3> 5.6  Run-time Errors</H3>
<P> Run-time errors are errors in the program detected during its execution. In this case an error message is given and a dump of the call stack of objects is generated on the file foo.dump if the program is named foo.</P>
<P> Consider the following fragments (note that the name of the fragments are complete UNIX file paths) </P>

<PRE class=beta>
 /usr/smith/mylib.bet:
 
 ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/betaenv'
 --LIB: attributes--
 lib1: (# do INNER #);
 lib2: lib1 
   (# T: (# x: @integer #);
      R: ^T
   do (* &amp;T[]-&gt;R[] *) 
      111-&gt;R.x; (* R[] is NONE *)
      INNER
   #);
 lib3: lib2(# do 'hello'-&gt;putLine #) 
 /usr/smith/runtimeerr.bet:
 
 ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/betaenv'; 
 INCLUDE 'mylib' 
 --PROGRAM: descriptor--
 (# foo1: (# do foo2 #);
    foo2: (# do foo.foo3 #);
    foo: @(# foo3: (# do lib3 #)#)
 do foo1
 #)
</PRE>

<P> Execution of this program on a sun4 machine will result in the
following runtimeerr.dump file:

<PRE class=beta> 
 Beta execution aborted: Reference is none.
 
 Call chain: (sun4)
 
   item lib3#&lt;lib2#&gt;lib1# in /usr/smith/mylib
     -- BETAENV-~ in ~beta/basiclib/betaenv
   item &lt;foo3#&gt; in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
     -- foo# in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
   item &lt;foo2#&gt; in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
     -- PROGRAM-~ in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
   item &lt;foo1#&gt; in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
     -- PROGRAM-~ in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
   comp &lt;PROGRAM-~&gt; in /usr/smith/runtimeerr
 
   basic component in ~beta/basiclib/betaenv
</PRE>

<P> The information in runtimeerr.dump has the following meaning: </P>

<ul>

 <li> The activation stack of invoked objects is shown. Each element
of the stack is shown as two lines. The object and its statically
enclosing object.</P>

 <li> For each object, the name of the file where it is defined is
also shown.

 <li> From the above file it can be seen that the error occurred in an
instance of lib3. The description lib3#&lt;lib2#&gt;lib1 shows the
superpattern chain of lib3. The braces (&lt;,&gt;) indicates that the
error occurred in the do-part of lib2.</P>

 <li>The symbol immediately after the name of an object shows its
kind. The different possibilities are:

</ul>

<P> # The descriptor belongs to a pattern, e.g. P: (#...#)</P>
<P> ~ Singular named descriptor, e.g. X: @(# ... #)</P>
<P> * Singular unnamed descriptor, e.g.  ...; (# ... #);...</P>
<P> - Descriptor SLOT.</P>
<P>  Notice that, e.g. the PROGRAM SLOT is marked with both - and ~ since a descriptor SLOT gives rise to a singular named descriptor.</P>

<ul>

 <li>It can be seen that lib3 was called from foo3, which was called
from foo2, which was called from foo1, etc. The bottom most objects
are defined in betaenv.

 <li> For each active object its enclosing object is shown, on a line
starting with '--' The encloser of e.g. foo3 is foo. The rest of the
objects have enclosers, which are slots.

 <li> For each object, the corresponding fragment file is shown. The
pattern lib3 is defined in the file

</ul>

<PRE class=beta> /usr/smith/mylib </PRE>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1704></A>
<H2> 6.  Compiler Arguments</H2>

<P> When activating the BETA compiler, the following command line
arguments are valid. </P>

<P> Most options have both a &quot;--&lt;name&gt;&quot; and a
&quot;--no&lt;name&gt;&quot; form: Activate the option using
&quot;--&lt;name&gt;&quot;; deactivate the option using
&quot;--no&lt;name&gt;&quot;. In the listing below, the activating
form is shown first (and explained), if both exist for an option.</P>

<P> For most options, there is a short (one-character) option for the
non-default form. One-character options allow multiple option
characters after the &quot;-&quot; (e.g. &quot;-qwd&quot;).</P>

<P> Long option names are case insensitive, whereas one-character
options are case sensitive.</P>

<P> A star (<B>*</B>) in the listings below indicates the
<I>default</I> option.</P>

<P> <B>--help</B> <B>-h</B> Show a brief overview of the legal command line options</P>
<P> </P>
<P> <B>--repeat</B>  <B>-r </B> Run compiler in repeating mode. After having translated the fragments specified in the argument list, if in repeating mode, the compiler prompts the user for the name of another fragment to be translated: </P>
<P> </P>
<P>        Type Fragment File Name:</P>
<P> </P>
<P>   This interaction is continued until the compiler is explicitly killed, e.g. by sending a control-C or the end-of-stream character to the compiler process. </P>
<P>   The compiler may also be given additional options at the prompt, e.g. you may type --nolink foo.bet to translate foo.bet, but avoid linking of it.</P>
<P>   If no new fragments are specified at the prompt, the compiler will retranslate the last fragment it has translated when &lt;RETURN&gt; it typed.</P>
<P>   By using repeating mode, the compiler saves time when analyzing dependencies between fragments, since fragments are saved in memory between compilations. </P>

Switches are specified as integers on the command line after --switch or -s, possibly terminated by a 0 (zero).

<A NAME=HEADING2-1792></A>
<H2> 7. Machine Dependent Configurations</H2>
<P> In this section, the terminology of the fragment system is used freely without further explanation. The fragment system has been extended to support generic software descriptions. The same generic software description may be used to instantiate configurations for different machines. The term 'machine' covers a CPU and an operating system running on that CPU. </P>
<P> The concept of generic software descriptions is implemented by means of special 'generic properties'. Normally, a property has exactly <I>one</I> associated set of values. A generic property has <I>a number of</I> such value-sets. The idea is that the programmer can specify a value-set for each machine. These value-sets are the ones termed <I>&lt;MachineSpecificationList&gt;</I> in the formal specification of properties in section 6.3 and 6.5. As an example: 

<PRE class=beta>
 OBJFILE  sun4s   'xlib.o'
          linux   'zlib.o' 
          default 'wlib.o'
</PRE>

<P> <A NAME=MARKER-2-34></A>OBJFILE is the name of a generic property. The OBJFILE property is used for inclusion in the linkage phase of external object files, e.g. produced by a C compiler. A generic property specification should be seen as a kind of 'switch/case' statement. The semantics of the above OBJFILE property is that when instantiating a configuration for the machine sun4s, the value  xlib.o is chosen. This means that the object file xlib.o  is included when linking a configuration for a sun4s machine. Similarly for linux machines. The default literal indicates that when instantiating configurations for machines <I>other</I> than sun4s  or linux , the object file wlib.o should be included. </P>
<P> Besides OBJFILE, there are the following generic properties: MAKE, BETARUN, LIBFILE, LINKOPT, RESOURCE, and MDBODY. For all of these properties, the relation between machine symbols and value-sets are specified in the same manner as described above. To be precise, the following algorithm is used when instantiating a configuration for a specific machine type, say A.</P>
<P> 1. If A matches any of the machine symbols of the generic property, the value-set associated with that particular machine symbol is chosen. If no match is possible, proceed with step 2. </P>
<P> 2. If the symbol default is specified as machine symbol, the associated value-set is chosen. If not, a warning is issued. </P>
<P> The only distinction between the different generic properties is in the interpretation of the elements of the chosen value-set. For OBJFILE, the value-set is interpreted as external object files. MAKE is meant to point out a number of so-called makefiles. These are executed just prior to the linkage phase. A makefile is often used to keep the included object files up to date with respect to the source files from which they originate. For BETARUN, the value-sets must contain exactly one element, and this element denotes the runtime system to be used in the resulting configuration. With respect to LIBFILE, the elements of the value-sets are interpreted as external libraries, e.g. the X11 library, to be included in the linkage phase. The chosen value-set in an MDBODY property denotes ordinary BETA fragments to be treated as if they had been specified by means of a normal BODY property. The MDBODY property may thus be used to specify that a fragment appears in a number of machine dependent variants. Finally, the LINKOPT property denotes arguments to append to the link-directive in the linking phase of compilations. Finally, the RESOURCE property is used (only on PC and Macintosh) to specify a set of resource files to add to the application.</P>
<P> Configurations are instantiated by the compiler, by default for the machine on which the compilation takes place. It is possible to instantiate a configuration for a machine other than the one, on which the compilation is performed ('cross-compilation'). This requires extensions to the Mj&oslash;lner System; please contact Mj&oslash;lner Informatics if this is needed.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-1804></A>
<H3> 9.1 BUILD Property</H3>
<P> The BUILD property unifies the OBJFILE and MAKE properties. The BUILD property is used to specify rules for keeping external (i.e. non-BETA) sources up to date, and to include the external files in the link directive.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-1806></A>
<H4> Syntax:</H4>
<PRE class=beta>
 BUILD &lt;machine&gt; '&lt;objectfile&gt;' 
      '&lt;dep1&gt;' '&lt;dep2&gt;' ... '&lt;depN&gt;' 
      '&lt;command&gt;';
</PRE>
<P> where</P>

<P> &lt;machine&gt; is the target machine specification (see MDBODY description)</P>

<P> &lt;objectfile&gt; is the external objectfile to include and possibly maintain. A $$ in this specification is expanded to the machine type. This is unlike other properties, like MDBODY, where a single $ is expanded to the machine type. If a backslash (\) or a newline must be included literally in the specification, it must be quoted with backslash.</P>

<PRE class=beta>
 &lt;dep1&gt;
 &lt;dep2&gt;
 ...
 &lt;depN&gt;  
</PRE>

<P>Are source files, that the &lt;objectfile&gt; depends on. </P>
<P> &lt;command&gt; is a command (sequence) that is executed by the compiler as it is, except for the following substitutions:</P>
<P>  $$ is expanded to the machine type, as explained above.</P>
<P>  $0 is expanded to &lt;objectfile&gt;</P>
<P>  $1 is expanded to &lt;dep1&gt;</P>
<P>  $2 is expanded to &lt;dep2&gt;</P>
<P>  ...</P>
<P>  $N is expanded to &lt;depN&gt;</P>
<P>  If a backslash (\) or a newline must be included literally in the commands, it must be quoted with backslash.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-1825></A>
<H4> Functionality</H4>
<P> The &lt;objectfile&gt; is included in the link directive. The compiler will execute &lt;commands&gt; if and only if</P>
<P> a.  &lt;objectfile&gt; does not exist</P>
<P> or </P>
<P> b.  any of the files &lt;dep1&gt;, &lt;dep2&gt;, ... &lt;depN&gt; are newer than an existing &lt;objectfile&gt;</P>
<P> The compiler will execute &lt;commands&gt; from the directory in which the file containing the BUILD property resides.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-1831></A>
<H4> Example</H4>
<P> If the object file foo.o (foo.obj) is to be generated from the foo.c file in the external directory, but also depends on the foo.h file in the external directory, you could specify this as:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
BUILD nti     '$$/foo.obj' 'external/foo.c' 'external/foo.h'
              'cl -c $1 -Fo$0 -nologo -w -O2 -Zd -Zp4'
      ppcmac  ':$$:foo.obj' ':external:foo.c' ':external:foo.h'
                 'MrC -D MAC -o $0 $1'
      default '$$/foo.o'   'external/foo.c' 'external/foo.h'
              '$CC -o $1 $2';
</PRE>

<P> Notice, that regular environment variables may be used in the &lt;commands&gt; specification, e.g. in the default (UNIX) specification, the variable CC are used (on UNIX, this is always set to an appropriate value in the job-file).</P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1840></A>
<H4> More than one build pr. fragment</H4>
<P> In general, more than one build pr. fragment will not work. The reason is that the meta-programming system combines all build directives into one directive (property). This means that:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
 BUILD sun4s 'cc1' default 'cc2'; 
 BUILD sun4s 'cc3' default 'cc4'
</PRE

<P> means the same as:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
 BUILD sun4s 'cc1' default 'cc2' sun4s 'cc3' default 'cc4'
</PRE>

<P> BUILD 'executes' all entries for a given plaform. This means that
the 2 sun4s entries will be executed for sun4s. The 2 default entries
will be executed for all other platforms.</P>

<P> If the following two build entries are used:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
 BUILD sun4s 'cc1' default 'cc2'; 
 BUILD sgi   'cc3' default 'cc4'
</PRE>

<P> ONLY cc1 will be executed for sun4s and ONLY cc3 for sgi, and the
2 default entries for all other platforms. This is probably not what
is intedended: For sun4s you would expect cc1 and cc4 to be executed
and sgi, cc2 and cc3.</P>

<P> To fix this, changes in the meaning of properties in MPS must be
changed.</P>

<P> Summary: more than one build directive in a fragment file will work if they have the same structure with respect to platform.</P>
<P> Alternative</P>
<P> It would be easy to implementa build directives on the form:</P>

<PRE class=beta>
 BUILD1 sun4s 'cc1' default 'cc2'; 
 BUILD2 sgi   'cc3' default 'cc4'
</PRE>

<P> This will give different properties and the compiler can be made to handle this. It is, however, not an ideal solution.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1859></A>
<H2> 8. Code Generation for Multiple Machines</H2>
<P> When instantiating a configuration for some machine, a number of object files are produced by the compiler - one for each fragment contributing to the configuration. On most architectures, the compiler actually generates symbolic assembly code, and this code is turned into object files by means of the native assembler. The native linker is used to produce an executable image for the machine in question on basis of these object files. </P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1861></A>
<H3> 8.1 Placement of Object Code </H3>
<P> Different machines normally use different formats for object files. The files containing object code and symbolic assembly code are always placed in a sub-directory relative to the directory containing the common source code. A sub-directory is created for each special object file format. Currently the following subdirectories are used: </P>

<PRE class=beta>
 sun4s    SUN-4 (SPARC) running Solaris 2.x
 hpux9pa  HP 9000/700 running HP-UX 9.x
 sgi      Silicon Graphics (MIPS) running IRIX 5.3
 linux    PC running Linux 1.0 or later
 nti      PC running Windows NT or Windows 95
 ppcmac   Power   Macintosh 3.2 or later
</PRE>

<P> For executable images to be activated directly, without prefixing their name with the name of a sub-directory, executable images are placed in the same directory as the common source files. It is however possible to control the naming of the executable images. This is done by means of the -o option to the compiler. </P>

<A NAME=HEADING2-1871></A>
<H3> 8.2 Macro Expansion<A NAME=MARKER-2-35></A></H3>
<P> Consider this use of the MDBODY property:</P>
<P>       MDBODY default './$/betaenvbody_$'</P>
<P> The symbol $ is expanded by the compiler. It is expanded to the name of the subdirectory into which the generated code will be placed. That is, if code is generated for a ppcmac (Macintosh) machine, the above expands to ./ppcmac/betaenvbody_mac. This may be a convenient short-hand, but may also make is possible to instantiate configurations for new machines without changing the original source code. </P>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-2>[2] </A>
 On mostsome platforms, binary code is generated directly. In this case, the assembly phase is omitted.
<HR>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-3>[3] </A>
 On mostsome platforms, binary code is generated directly. On the HP platform, the compiler generates assembly code which is assembled before linking. In this case, the assembly phase is omitted.
<HR>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-4>[4] </A>
 This is currently not possible on Windows and Macintosh.
<HR>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-5>[5] </A>
 On mostsome platforms, binary machine code is generated directly. In this case, no assembly file is generated.

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-6>[6] </A>
 Some semantic errors may cause the compiler to fail without generating a pretty print. There should however always be an error indication on the screen. In case the compiler fails during checking and it is not obvious for what reason, it is possible to trace the checking of declarations and imperatives using the option --traceCheck (see section 8). However, this may generate a large amount of output on the screen. The compiler may also fail during code generation. These errors may be traced using option --traceCode. However, tracing errors in this way should rarely be needed.
