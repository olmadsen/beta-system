<H1>8.1  Coroutines</H1>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Deterministic coroutines have demonstrated their usefulness through many years of usage in e.g. Simula. In [DH72] many examples are given. Further examples of coroutines in BETA may be found in [KKMN88] and [MMN92]. Below we give a typical example of using coroutines.
</DL>
<P> Suppose we have a register for the permanent workers and another one for the hourly paid workers. Suppose also that its is possible to sort these registers according to a given criteria like the total hours worked by the employee. Suppose that we want to produce a list of names of all employees sorted according the total hours worked. This may be done by merging the two registers. A <CODE>Register</CODE> object has a scan operation that makes it possible to go through all elements of the register. Instead we define an operation of <CODE>Register</CODE> in the form of a coroutine <CODE>getNext</CODE>, which delivers the next element of the register when called:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
Register:
  (# ...
     getNext: | @
       (# elm: ^ employee
       <EM>do</EM> scan(#<EM>do</EM> thisElm[]<EM>-></EM>elm[]; <EM>suspend</EM> #);
          none<EM>-></EM>elm[]
       <EM>exit</EM> elm[]
       #);
  #);
pReg: @ PermanentRegister; hReg: @ HourlyPaidRegister;
...
pReg.getNext<EM>-></EM>e1[]; hReg.getnext<EM>-></EM>e2[];
L: cycle
  (#
  <EM>do</EM> (<EM>if</EM> e1[] // none <EM>then</EM> {empty hReg}; <EM>leave</EM> L <EM>if</EM>);
     (<EM>if</EM> e2[] // none <EM>then</EM> {empty pReg}; <EM>leave</EM> L <EM>if</EM>);
     (<EM>if</EM> e1.totalHours &lt; e2.totalHours// true <EM>then
     </EM>e1.print; pReg.getNext<EM>-></EM>e1[]
     <EM>else</EM>e2.print; hReg.getNext<EM>-></EM>e2[]
     <EM>if</EM>)
  #)
</PRE>

<DL> 
<DT><DD>The attributes <CODE>getNext</CODE> of the objects
<CODE>pReg</CODE> and <CODE>hReg</CODE> have their own thread of
execution. When called in an imperative like,
<CODE>pReg.getNext<EM>->e1[]</EM></CODE>, the thread is executed until
it either executes a suspend or terminates. If it executes a suspend,
it may be called again in which case it will resume execution at the
point of <EM>suspend</EM>. The first time <CODE>getNext</CODE> is
called, it will start executing <CODE>scan</CODE>. For each element in
the register, it will suspend execution and exit the current element
via the exit variable <CODE>elm[]</CODE>. When the register is empty,
<CODE>NONE</CODE> is returned.
