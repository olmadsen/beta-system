<H1>5  <A NAME=MARKER-9-1></A>Control patterns</H1>

Sub (procedure) patterns are used intensively in BETA for defining
control patterns (control structures). This includes simple control
patterns like <CODE>cycle</CODE>, <CODE>forTo</CODE>, etc. It also
includes so-called iterators on data objects like <CODE>list</CODE>,
<CODE>set</CODE> and <CODE>register</CODE>. A pattern describing a
register of objects may have the following interface:

<PRE CLASS=beta>
Register:
  (# has: (# E: ^ type; B: @ boolean <EM>enter</EM> E[] <EM>do</EM> ... <EM>exit</EM> B #);
     insert: (# E: ^type <EM>enter</EM> E[] <EM>do</EM> ... #);
     delete: (# E: ^type <EM>enter</EM> E[] <EM>do</EM> ... #);
     scan: <EM>(#</EM> thisElm: ^ type <EM>do</EM> <CODE>... <EM>inner</EM></CODE> ... #);
     ...
  #)
</PRE>

A number of details, has been left out from the example. This includes
the representation and implementation of the <CODE>Register</CODE>. A
<CODE>Register</CODE> may include instances of the pattern
<CODE>type</CODE>, which has not been specified. <CODE>Type</CODE> is
an example of a virtual class pattern which will be introduced
below. For the moment <CODE>type</CODE> is assumed to stand for the
pattern <CODE>object</CODE> which is a superclass of all
patterns. I.e. a <CODE>Register</CODE> may include instances of all
patterns. An instance of <CODE>Register</CODE> may be declared and
used as follows:

<PRE CLASS=beta>
   employees: @ Register
   ...
<EM>do</EM>mary[]->employees.insert; 
   <EM>(if</EM> boss[]->employees.has//true <EM>then</EM> ... <EM>if)</EM>
</PRE>

The control pattern <CODE>scan</CODE> may be used as follows:

<PRE CLASS=beta>
0->totalSalary;
employees.scan<EM>(#do</EM> thisElm.computeSalary+totalSalary->totalSalary <EM>#)</EM>;
totalSalary->screen.putInt
</PRE>

This works as follows:

<UL>
<LI>The imperative <CODE>employees.scan(# ... #)</CODE> is an example
of a singular action object as mentioned in section 3.

<LI>The do-part of scan has an <EM>inner</EM> imperative which is
executed for each element in the register. The details of this is not
shown, but it may be implemented as a loop that steps through the
elements of the register and executes <EM>inner</EM> for each element.

<LI>The attribute <CODE>thisElm</CODE> of <CODE>scan</CODE> is used as
an index variable that for each iteration refers to the current
element of the register. This may be implemented by assigning the
reference of the current element to <CODE>thisElm</CODE> before
<EM>inner</EM> is executed.

<LI>The effect of executing the above singular action object is that
<CODE>thisElm.computeSalary<EM>->S </EM></CODE>is executed for each
element in the register.
</UL>
