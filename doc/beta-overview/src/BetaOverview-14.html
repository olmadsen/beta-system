<H1>8.2  Concurrency</H1>
<DL>
<DT><DD>As previously mentioned, it is possible to perform concurrent execution of components by means of the fork operations as sketched in the following example:
</DL>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
(# S1: @ | (# ... <EM>do</EM> ... #);
   S2: @ | (# ... <EM>do</EM> ... #);
   S3: @ | (# ... <EM>do</EM> ... #)
<EM>do</EM> S1.fork; S2.fork; S3.fork; ... 
#)
</PRE>
<DL>
<DT><DD>The execution of <CODE>S1</CODE>, <CODE>S2 </CODE>and <CODE>S3</CODE> will take place concurrently with each other and with the object executing the fork operations. Concurrent objects may access the same shared objects without synchronization, but may synchronize access to shared objects by means of semaphores. In section 4 above the pattern <CODE>Semaphore</CODE> has been described. It is well known that a semaphore is a low level synchronization mechanism which may be difficult to use in other than simple situations. For this reason the Mj&oslash;lner BETA library has a number of patterns defining higher level synchronization mechanisms. This library includes a <CODE>Monitor</CODE> pattern as described in section 4 above. The library also includes patterns defining synchronization in the form of rendezvous in CSP [Hoa74] and Ada [ADA82].
