<H1>3  Singular objects</H1>

Often there is only one object of a given type. In most languages it
is still necessary to make a class and generate a single instance. In
BETA it is possible to describe a singular object directly. There is
only one president of our company and he may be described as the
following singular object:

<PRE CLASS=beta>
president: @ Employee
  (# ComputeSalary::&lt; (#<EM>do</EM> BIG ->salary #)
  #)
</PRE>

The declaration <CODE>president</CODE> is similar to the declaration
of <CODE>mary</CODE>. The difference is that in the declaration of
<CODE>mary</CODE>, a pattern name (<CODE>Worker</CODE>) describes the
objects whereas a complete object description is used to describe the
<CODE>president</CODE>.

<P> The <CODE>president</CODE> object is an example of a singular data
object corresponding to an instance of a class pattern. It is also
possible to describe singular action objects corresponding to an
instance of a procedure pattern. Singular action objects are similar
to blocks in Algol 60 and Simula. Examples of singular action objects
are given below in <A HREF="BetaOverview-7.html#MARKER-9-1">section
5</A>.</P>
