<DT><DD>BETA is a language for representing/modeling concepts and phenomena from the application domain and for implementing such concepts and phenomena on a computer system. Part of a BETA program describes objects and patterns that represent phenomena and concepts from the application model. This part is said to be representative since BETA elements at this level are meaningful with respect to the application domain. Other parts of a BETA program are non-representative, since they do not correspond to elements of the application domain, but are intended for realizing the model as a computer system.
</DL>
<P> The BETA language as presented in this paper, is for describing objects and patterns. The objects and patterns constitute the logical structure of a program execution. This physical structure of a program execution is handled by other components of the Mj&oslash;lner BETA System which is a programming environment supporting BETA. The Mj&oslash;lner BETA System provides the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Mechanisms for splitting a large BETA program into a set of modules.
<LI>Mechanisms for protecting the attributes of an object like hidden, protected and private in Simula and C++. In addition there are mechanisms for physically separating the interface of a pattern from its implementation
<LI>Mechanisms for defining alternative implementations/variants of a pattern.
<LI>Mechanisms for defining which objects are persistent and which are transient
<LI>Mechanisms for assigning active objects to processors on a computer system. I.e. handling distribution.
</UL>
