<H1>Simple Types and Output</H1>
<P> In our next program we declare variables of the 4 basic types defined in BETA: integer, real, char and boolean. Values are assigned to these variables and they are written out. The first version of our program is shown in Program 2.1.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING6-4></A>
<BETA SRC="$BETALIB/demo/tutorial/SimpleTypesWithErrors.bet" LIST="SimpleTypesWithErrors.bet">

<P> Again, one notes the initial fragment <INX>ORIGIN</INX> statement, a comment, and then the program. </P>

<P> The declarations are Pascal-like with the addition of the @ character. In BETA, the same declaration syntax will be used for types, variables, classes and procedures. In this context, the @ denotes a static variable declaration whereas a declaration without the @ corresponds to a type declaration. </P>
<P> The first few statements after the do show arithmetic and assignment. Arithmetic expressions follow convention; the usual operators (+,- ,* , / (or div) and mod) are provided. Assignment goes left to right following the arrow and multiple assignment is allowed.</P>
<P> The next few lines show the syntax of real, character and boolean constants. Note that characters use the same delimiters as text strings.</P>
<P> In the remainder of the program we do output. The procedures used are:</P>

<UL>
<LI> newline:  skips to a new line
<LI> puttext:  writes a text
<LI> putline:  same as puttext followed by newline
<LI> putreal:  outputs a real
<LI> put:  outputs a character
<LI> putboolean: outputs a boolean
</UL>

<P> Characters are type compatible with integers and can be used interchangeably in expressions. An example of this is shown at the end of the program. </P>
<P> When we try to compile SimpleTypesWithErrors.bet, we get the following semantic error message:</P>
<BETA>
putreal
   *****Name is not declared
putboolean
   *****Name is not declared
</BETA>

<P> There is also a complete listing of the program text with the same
error messages in SimpleTypesWithErrors.lst to help localize the
errors. In this case the error is due to the fact that putreal is not
in the standard environment. putreal is in a library that must be
included in the program
<FOOTNOTE>putreal is not in the standard environment in order to
minimize the size of the resulting binary excutable for simple
programs that only uses the basic environment. numberio contains
operations like, put/getreal and put/getbased</FOOTNOTE>. 

Likewise putboolean is in the textUtils library.</P>
<P> The Mj&oslash;lner System comes with a library supporting a wide
range of input and output for numbers (integers, based integers,
reals, etc.) called numberio. In order to print reals on the screen,
this library must be included. A library is included using a fragment
<INX>INCLUDE</INX> statement:</P>

<P> And the results are shown below.</P>
<P> </P>
<BETA>
Printing out integers
  i = 111
  j = 10
  k = 141

Printing out reals: 
  x = 3.141500
  y = 1000000.000000
  z = 0.000000

Now for a character, C=&quot;X&quot; and as a integer: 88

Printing out booleans: 
  B1 = true
  B2 = false

Now for something very C-like.
  'A'+ 3->put: D
