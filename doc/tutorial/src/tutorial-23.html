<H1>Directory</H1>

<P> Directory handling is very similar to file handling in the Mj&oslash;lner System. Files and directories have similar properties like name, path, etc. Files are special since the contents typically are characters that can be read and written, directories are special since the contents are files and directories. These similar and special properties are both modeled in the file and directory libraries.</P>
<P> When using the directory library, a directory is simply declared as</P>
<BETA>
ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/directory';
...
  d: @directory;
...
</BETA>
<P> A directory can be given a name:</P>

<BETA>
'myDir' -> d.name;
</BETA>
<P> And it can be tested for existence, content, entries, and be scanned:</P>
<UL>
<LI> d.exists: returns true if the directory exists
<LI> d.empty: returns true if the directory has some content
<LI> d.noOfEntries: returns the number of entries (files and directories) in the directory.
<LI> d.scanEntries: calls INNER for each entry (found) in the directory.
</UL>
<P> The following program shows a simple use of directory: The directory with the path given as argument is scanned, and the names of all the entries are printed.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING23-15></A>
<BETA SRC="$BETALIB/demo/tutorial/ListDir.bet" LIST="ListDir.bet">

<P> This program also checks for the number of arguments. If the number of arguments is not 2, then an error message is printed, and stop is called. stop is defined in the basic environment betaenv, and when called, terminates the execution.</P>
<P> Below we show the output of ListDir on the current working directory:</P>
