Hi</pre>
      <pre>I am investigating the possibilities for integrating the Mjolner Tool
with Eclipse.</pre>
      <pre>Mjolner Tool is a complete IDE for developing software
in the object oriented programming language BETA, and both BETA and
Mjolner Tool are developed and maintained by Mjolner Informatics
(www.mjolner.com). Mjolner Tool thus contains facilities for syntactic
code browsing, editing, compiling, running, debugging, designing GUIs
through a graphical interface, UML visualizing and reverse
engineering.</pre>
      <pre>This means: a lot of code! The Mjolner Tool source code
is of course written in BETA, so how should we interface with Eclipse?</pre>
      <pre>BETA compiles to native code on several platforms: Solaris/SPARC,
HP-UX, Irix/MIPS, Linux, Win95, WinNT, Mac/PowerPC. Although work is
currently being done towards generating Java bytecode, at this moment
it is by no means a realistic possibility for our Eclipse integration
to use this.</pre>
      <pre>I'd very much like to hear about ideas for interfacing between our
existing
IDE
application and the Eclipse Framework, as well as descriptions of
other developers' approaches. Surely, there must be other tools being
integrated with Eclipse, that don't luckily have their existing code
available in Java?</pre>
      <pre>Regards,

      <pre>It depends on what kind of code you want to integrate.
If you have a bunch of native libraries that are non-UI, then
it should be fairly straightforward to integrate with JNI.
SWT also provides COM support that you can use to integrate
via COM on windows if you want to make COM controls, but the
JNI approach is more straightforward.</pre>
      <pre>For UI code, on Windows you can either implement new SWT widgets
to wrapper native window handles or if you make an ActiveX
control out of your native code, SWT provides ActiveX
integration capability.</pre>
      <pre>For other platforms, you can write a new SWT widget to wrapper
native window handles much the same way SWT wrappers native
widgets on those platforms.</pre>
      <pre>If you have widgets that you have already implemented natively,
and want to reuse them, then writing a new SWT widget to wrapper
these native widgets may be the best approach.</pre>
      <pre>There is an article on eclipse.org that talks about building
new SWT widgets like this.  The article is called:
&quot;Creating Your Own Widgets using SWT&quot;</pre>
      <pre>There is also an article on the ActiveX support:
&quot;ActiveX Support in SWT&quot;</pre>
      <pre>I didn't post the links because they are long and gets wrapped.
Just click on articles in the nav bar and scroll down to the SWT
section.</pre>
      <pre>Hope this helps.</pre>

      <pre>Integrating command line versions of existing tools is
another possible path. Obviously this means you
will loose the existing IDE functions of your tool set, but
this could be a quick start to enable BETA development
under Eclipse.</pre>
      <pre>We went down this path for a basic C plugin
that is part of the IBM VisualAge Micro Edition.
This required implementing the following Eclipse components:
* building/compiling: implement an Eclipse Builder that calls a &quot;make&quot;
command.
   Analyze the output of make and generate problem markers.
* editing: implement a C editor and a parser to populate and
    reconcile the outline view.
* searching: only text searching is supported, you get it for free
   from Eclipse.
* running: implement a launcher that can run an executable.
* debugging: the platform provides a language independent debugging model.
   Once you implement this model API you get the debugger UI almost for
   free. We didn't get to this for the C plugin, mostly because of the
   lack of published APIs to existing C debuggers.</pre>
