<H3>AVAILABILITY</H3><PRE>
     The Mjolner BETA tar(1) front-end is available  as  part  of
     the Mjolner System from Mjolner Informatics.
</PRE>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3><PRE>
     <EM>betatar</EM> is an front-end to the <STRONG>tar(1)</STRONG> file archive system on
     UNIX  systems. <EM>betatar</EM> is used to create a tar(1) archive of
     all files related to  a  BETA  fragment  file  (BETA  source
     files,  etc.)  <EM>betatar</EM>  is intended to be used for packaging
     the entire set of files, contributing to a given  BETA  pro-
     gram  in  order to move this program to another installation
     for further work (debugging or further development).   Typi-
     cal usages include moving a program between, say, a Linux PC
     at home and the UNIX workstation at work, between  different
     development teams.

     <EM>betatar</EM> offers many different options for controlling  which
     files  are  packaged  into the <STRONG>tar</STRONG> file.  The most important
     aspect of <EM>betatar</EM> is that  it  ensures  that  all  necessary
     files  are collected into the tar(1) file (except if certain
     options are used - see later), such that, when unpacked, all
     needed files will be in place for continued work.

     <EM>betatar</EM> works by traversing  the  dependency  graph  of  the
     fragment  graph,  following ORIGIN, INCLUDE, BODY and MDBODY
     fragment links, starting at the fragment  specified  in  the
     file  given  as  argument  to <EM>betatar</EM>. During this traversal
     (identical to the dependency analysis conducted by the  BETA
     compiler),  <EM>betatar</EM>  selects the fragments to be included in
     the tar(1) file, depending on the different  options  speci-
     fied to <EM>betatar</EM>.

<H3>OPTIONS</H3><PRE>
     <STRONG>--help</STRONG>
          Print this help info
     <STRONG>--extent</STRONG>
          Traverse the entire dependency  graph,  including  BODY
          and MDBODY fragments.
     <STRONG>--domain</STRONG>
          Traverse the dependency graph, ignoring BODY and MDBODY
          fragments.
     <STRONG>--full</STRONG>
          Choose all fragments found during the traversal of  the
          dependency  graph.   This  includes  standard libraries
          from the Mjolner System.  If --<EM>full</EM> is not  speci-
          fied,  all  fragments  located in $BETALIB/ are ignored
          (i.e. standard files are not  packed  into  the  tar(1)
          file).
     <STRONG>--exclude</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
          Ignore fragments found in the traversal if they contain
          <EM>string</EM>  in  their  filename, surrounded by '/' (e.g. --
          <EM>exclude</EM> <EM>basiclib</EM> will result in all fragments  contain-
          ing  '/basiclib/' will be ignored.  Note: <EM>string</EM> may be
          any <STRONG>egrep(1)</STRONG> pattern.
          This option may be specified repeatedly in the  command
          line, with different strings.  The effect will be, that
          all these fragments are ignored.
     <STRONG>--ast</STRONG>
          Include .ast/.astL files in the  tar(1)  file  (if  the
          corresponding .bet file are selected).
     <STRONG>--asm</STRONG>
          Include ..s assembler files (if present) in the  tar(1)
          file (if the corresponding .bet file are selected).
     <STRONG>--code</STRONG>
          Include .o code files (if present) in the tar file  (if
          the corresponding .bet file are selected).
     <STRONG>--debug</STRONG>
          Include ..db debug files (if present) in the  tar  file
          (if the corresponding .bet file are selected).
     <STRONG>--job</STRONG>
          Include the .job file (if present)
     <STRONG>--dump</STRONG>
          Include the .dump file (if present)
     <STRONG>--verbose</STRONG>
          print what is saved onto the tar file
     <STRONG>--noCompress</STRONG>
          do not compress the tar file
     <STRONG>--gzip</STRONG>
          use <STRONG>gzip(1)</STRONG> instead of <STRONG>compress(1)</STRONG> to compress the  tar
          file.
     <STRONG>--list</STRONG>
          list the files to be packed. Do not actually  pack  the
          files.

<H3>ENVIRONMENT</H3><PRE>
     <EM>betatar</EM> recognizes the environment variable $BETALIB. Please
     note that this variable is given default value in the Bourne
     Shell script $<EM>BETALIB</EM>/<EM>configuration</EM>/<EM>env.sh</EM>
     <STRONG>BETALIB</STRONG>
          Specifies where ~<EM>beta</EM> is located.  If not set, <EM>beta</EM>  is
          assumed  to  be  a  username,  and ~<EM>beta</EM> being the home
          directory of that user.  Is used by many tools  in  the
          Mjolner System.

<H3>BUGS</H3><PRE>
     Currently, <EM>betatar</EM> packs  the  files  with  full  file  path
     specifications,  making  it difficult to unpack the files at
     another location.
