<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2><PRE>
     The Mjolner BETA fragment analyzer is available as  part  of
     the Mjolner System from Mjolner Informatics.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <I>betawc</I> is a BETA fragment analyzer.  <I>betawc</I> is used to  find
     out  how  many fragment groups, how many fragment forms, how
     many lines of code, how many words, and how many  characters
     are in the dependency graph of the specified fragment.

     Furthermore, <I>betawc</I> tries to evaluate  which  libraries  are
     used in the specified fragment (either directly or indirect-
     ly throughout the entire  dependency  graph),  and  gives  a
     listing  of all fragment groups found during the analysis of
     the dependency graph of the specified fragment.

     During the analysis of  the  dependency,  <I>betawc</I>  will  give
     proper warnings of suspicious library versions, in the sense
     that there seems to be two versions of the same  library  in
     use in the same dependency graph.

     <I>betawc</I> works by traversing the dependency graph of the frag-
     ment graph, following ORIGIN, INCLUDE, BODY and MDBODY frag-
     ment links, starting at the fragment specified in  the  file
     given  as argument to <I>betawc</I>. During this traversal (identi-
     cal to the dependency analysis conducted by  the  BETA  com-
     piler),  <I>betawc</I>  selects the fragments to be included in the
     further analysis (count of fragment forms, etc.).

     The different <I>betawc</I> options may be used to control the part
     of  the dependency graph that are analysed, and the types of
     analysis conducted (see below).


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
      -a
     --all
          same as --conflict --full --list
      -c
     --conflict
          check for version conflicts
      -f
     --full
          include standard files (files located in $BETALIB)
      -x
     --ignore <I>rexp</I>
          ignore all files with names containing <I>rexp</I>. Note, that
          <I>rexp</I>  may  be  any regexp pattern.  "--ignore rexp" has
          precedence over all above options.
      -i
     --include <I>rexp</I>
          include all files containing <I>rexp</I>. Note, that <I>rexp</I>  may
          be any regexp pattern.  "--include rexp" has precedence
          over all above options.
      -l
     --list
          list the fragment groups in the dependency graph.
      -h
     --help
          Print this help info

</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <I>betawc</I> recognizes the environment variable $BETALIB.  Please
     note that this variable is given default value in the Bourne
     Shell script $<I>BETALIB</I>/<I>configuration</I>/<I>env</I>.<I>sh</I>
     BETALIB
          Specifies where ~<I>beta</I> is located.  If not set, <I>beta</I>  is
          assumed  to  be  a  username,  and ~<I>beta</I> being the home
          directory of that user.  Is used by many tools  in  the
          Mjolner System.
