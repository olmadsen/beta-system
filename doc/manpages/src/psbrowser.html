<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <I>psbrowser</I> is a generic object browser for  browsing  in  the
     object structures stored in a persistent store.

     The psbrowser is specialized to browse objects  found  in  a
     persistent  store  (~beta/persistentstore/).   Psbrowser  is
     able to browse objects whose code is not linked  int  o  the
     browser executable.

     Having launched the psbrowser, your next move is to  open  a
     persistent  store.   Do  so  by selecting "Open..." from the
     "File" menu. In the resulting dialog, enter the name of  the
     persistent  store  and  click  the  "Ok"  button.  A  nested
     rootlist listing the names of the persistent roots will  ap-
     pear.  The  name  of  the rootlist window corresponds to the
     name of the persistent store. It is allowed to open multiple
     persistent stores at a time.

     To open a window showing a persistent root  object,  double-
     click  the  name of that root in the rootlist. An ObjectView
     showing the root object will appear.

     The objectview uses abstract  presentation  of  the  objects
     presented.  This means that nested partobjects are initially
     shown contracted, i.e. as three dots. By  double-clicking  a
     line  of the object view ending in '...', the hidden details
     will be shown. By double-clicking the same line  again,  the
     details are hidden.

     Each line in the objectview corresponds to some attribute of
     the object.  Simple attributes (@Char, @Integer, ...) cannot
     be further detailed, whereas other kinds of attributes can.

     It is not possible to browse stores created on architectures
     with  an  endian different from that of the machine runnning
     the psbrowser (e.g. between Intel on the one hand and either
     Motorola, HP-PA, SGI-MIPS or SPARC on the other hand).

     However, it is a requirement that the  persistent  store  is
     created, using the so-called 'full name patch'.

     See the file ~beta/objectbrowser/psbrowser/README  for  more
     information on how to use psbrowser.
