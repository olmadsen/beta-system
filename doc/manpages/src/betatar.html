<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2><PRE>
     The Mjolner System <B>betatar(1)</B> utility is available  as  part
     of the Mjolner System from Mjolner Informatics.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <I>betatar</I> is an archiving program. <B>betatar(1)</B> makes  use  dif-
     ferent  external  programs, such as <B>tar(1)</B> or <B>zip(1)</B> and for
     compressing the files, <B>betatar(1)</B> makes use  of  <B>compress(1)</B>
     or  <B>gzip(1)</B>  Which  is  actually used depends on the options
     (see later).

     <I>betatar</I> is used to create an archive of all files related to
     a  BETA  fragment  file (BETA source files, etc.) <I>betatar</I> is
     intended to be used for packaging the entire set  of  files,
     contributing  to  a given BETA program in order to move this
     program to another installation for further work  (debugging
     or  further  development).   Typical usages include moving a
     program between, say, a PC at home and the UNIX  workstation
     at work, or between different development teams.

     <I>betatar</I> offers many different options for controlling  which
     files  are  packaged into the archive file.  The most impor-
     tant aspect of <I>betatar</I> is that it ensures that all necessary
     files are collected into the archive file (except if certain
     options are used - see later), such that, when unpacked, all
     needed files will be in place for continued work.

     <I>betatar</I> works by traversing  the  dependency  graph  of  the
     fragment  graph,  following ORIGIN, INCLUDE, BODY and MDBODY
     fragment links, starting at the fragment  specified  in  the
     file  given  as  argument  to <I>betatar</I>. During this traversal
     (identical to the dependency analysis conducted by the  BETA
     compiler),  <I>betatar</I>  selects the fragments to be included in
     the archive file, depending on the different options  speci-
     fied to <I>betatar</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
      -h
     --help
          Print this help info
      -e
     --extent
          Traverse the entire dependency  graph,  including  BODY
          and MDBODY fragments.
      -d
     --domain
          Traverse the dependency graph, ignoring BODY and MDBODY
          fragments.
      -f
     --full
          Choose all fragments found during the traversal of  the
          dependency  graph.   This  includes  standard libraries
          from the Mjolner BETA System.  If --<I>full</I> is not  speci-
          fied,  all  fragments  located in $BETALIB/ are ignored
          (i.e. standard files are not packed  into  the  archive
          file).
      -a
     --ast
          Include .ast/.astL files in the archive  file  (if  the
          corresponding .bet file are selected).
      -s
     --asm
          Include ..s assembler files (if present) in the archive
          file (if the corresponding .bet file are selected).
      -c
     --code
          Include .o code files (if present) in the archive  file
          (if the corresponding .bet file are selected).
      -b
     --debug
          Include ..db debug files (if present)  in  the  archive
          file (if the corresponding .bet file are selected).
      -j
     --job
          Include the .job file (if present)
      -u
     --dump
          Include the .dump file (if present)
      -t
     --total
          Include all file types (equiv. to "--ast  --asm  --code
          --debup --job --dump")
      -x
     --ignore <I>string</I>
          Ignore fragments found in the traversal if they contain
          <I>rexps</I>  in  their  filename (e.g. --<I>ignore</I> <I>basiclib</I> will
          result in all fragments containing 'basiclib'  will  be
          ignored.  Note: <I>rexps</I> may be any regexp pattern.
          This option may have more than one "rexp" in  the  com-
          mand line, with different regexps.  The effect will be,
          that all these fragments are ignored.  "--ignore  rexp"
          has precedence over all above options.
      -i
     --include <I>string</I>
          Include fragments found in the traversal if  they  con-
          tain  <I>rexps</I>  in their filename (e.g. --<I>include</I> <I>basiclib</I>
          will result in all fragments containing 'basiclib' will
          be included.  Note: <I>rexps</I> may be any regexp pattern.
          This option may have more than one "rexp" in  the  com-
          mand line, with different regexps.  The effect will be,
          that all  these  fragments  are  included.   "--include
          rexp" has precedence over all above options.
      -v
     --verbose
          print what is saved onto the archive file
      -m
     --compress
          compress the archive file
      -g
     --gzip
          use <B>gzip(1)</B> instead of <B>compress(1)</B> to compress the  ar-
          chive file.
      -z
     --zip
          use <B>zip(1)</B> instead of <B>tar(1)</B> to pack the files.
      -l
     --list
          list the files to be packed. Do not actually  pack  the
          files.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <I>betatar</I> recognizes the environment variable $BETALIB. Please
     note that this variable is given default value in the Bourne
     Shell script $<I>BETALIB</I>/<I>configuration</I>/<I>env</I>.<I>sh</I>
     BETALIB
          Specifies where ~<I>beta</I> is located.  If not set, <I>beta</I>  is
          assumed  to  be  a  username,  and ~<I>beta</I> being the home
          directory of that user.  Is used by many tools  in  the
          Mjolner System.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Currently, <I>betatar</I> packs  the  files  with  full  file  path
     specifications,  making  it difficult to unpack the files at
     another location.
