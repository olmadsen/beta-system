<H3>NAME</H3><PRE>
     frigg - Mjolner BETA User Interface Builder


</PRE>
<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3><PRE>
     <STRONG>frigg</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H3>AVAILABILITY</H3><PRE>
     The Mjolner BETA User Interface Builder is available as part
     of the Mjolner System from Mjolner Informatics.


</PRE>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3><PRE>
     <EM>Frigg</EM> is the user interface builder of the Mjolner Sys-
     tem,  it  aims  at supporting rapid prototyping and is meant
     primarily for system designers and developers.

     <EM>Frigg</EM> is embedded in <EM>Sif</EM> - the Mjolner BETA  Source  Browser
     and  Editor - and supplies a graphical editor that interacts
     with the <EM>sif(1)</EM> to create a prototyping environment.

     The user interface editor lets its users construct the  user
     interface  via direct manipulation, while the necessary code
     is generated automatically behind the scene.  The  generated
     code can be extended and tailored using the <EM>sif(1)</EM> structure
     editor, and this tailoring can take place at any time during
     the development of the user interface, because the graphical
     editor can keep track of the code even though the  code  has
     been  altered  in  the  structure  editor. The developer can
     therefore alternate between working on  the  user  interface
     and coding the underlying functionality.

<H3>OPTIONS</H3><PRE>
     (<EM>none)</EM>



</PRE>
<H3>ENVIRONMENT</H3><PRE>
     <EM>frigg</EM> recognizes the environment variable  $BETALIB.  Please
     note that this variable is given default value in the Bourne
     Shell script $<EM>BETALIB</EM>/<EM>configuration</EM>/<EM>env.sh</EM>

     <STRONG>BETALIB</STRONG>
          Specifies where ~<EM>beta</EM> is located.  If not set, <EM>beta</EM>  is
          assumed  to  be  a  username,  and ~<EM>beta</EM> being the home
          directory of that user.  Is used by many tools  in  the
          Mjolner System.
