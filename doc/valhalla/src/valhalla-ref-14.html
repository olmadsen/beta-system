<H3>The <INX>BETART environment variable</INX></H3>

<P> The BETART environment variable is described in <A
HREF="../betarun/BETART.html">BETART</A>. It may be used to
control the behavior of a BETA program in several ways. To set BETART
for a BETA program being debugged without affecting Valhalla
<FOOTNOTE>Valhalla is a BETA program itself</FOOTNOTE>,
set the BETART
environment variable either through the Valhalla command line option
<EM>ENVIRONMENT</EM>, or using the Environment Editor.</P>


<H3>Tracing <INX>garbage collections</INX></H3>

<P> If you wish to trace the garbage collection in the debugged process, you can do this by setting the BETART environment variable for the debugged process.  See <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia99-36">[MIA 99-36]</A>.</P>

<H3>Known bugs and <INX>inconveniences</INX></H3>
<UL>
<LI>In some cases (especially on SUN 4) the stack view does not display the full runtime stack, forgetting a number of entries. Likewise, the stack view may get confused if the debugged process is stopped while executing C code. This also has implications for Valhalla when deciding where a runtime error occurred, and might result in the wrong place being pointed out.
<LI>When a complex attribute has been detailed, the scrolllist implementing the view may enter an &quot;auto-scroll&quot; mode. Click some attribute to switch off this mode.
