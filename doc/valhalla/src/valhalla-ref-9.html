<H3><INX>Inspecting the current code</INX></H3>

<P> When the debugged process is stopped in some BETA code, and no
code view is opened on that code, selecting <EM>Current Code</EM> from
the <EM>Windows</EM> Menu of the Valhalla Universe opens a code view
with the current BETA imperative selected. If a code view on that code
is already opened, it is raised (and wriggled), and the current
imperative selected.<BR>
You can also press the "CODE" button in the Valhalla Universe, this has the same effect.</P>

<H3><INX>The code view</INX></H3>

<P> A code view displays an abstract textual description of a BETA object descriptor. Abstract means that nested object descriptors are displayed as three dots. Using the facilities of a code view it is possible to set breakpoints, perform expression searches, or simply inspect the textual description of the pattern.</P>

<P> Anywhere inside the code view, you can get access to the <EM>Breakpoints</EM> menu, simply by holding the right mouse button down.  This will pop-up the <EM>Breakpoints</EM> menu.</P>
