<H1> Debugger</H1>
In order to debug a program open the program in the mjolnertool. <BR>Choose the fragmentgroup containing the program descriptor. Often this file has the same name as your executable. Choose "Debug" in the "Compile/Run" menu. You can only debug a program if you have an executable, therefore you must compile your program before debugging. <P>
The debugger performs a check of all files used in the program, therefore it can take from a few seconds up to a minute to open the debugger on a large program.
<P> When finished initialising, Valhalla opens its Valhalla Universe containing a number of menus.  The figure shows the look of the <INX>Valhalla Universe</INX> when using Valhalla on the example program from the tutorial.</P>

<FIG LIST="The Valhalla Universe"> </FIG>
<P> The top pane of the Valhalla Universe contains the menus. The middle pane contains the different views, and the bottom pane contains two info areas and a number of buttons.</P>
<P> 

Editing is disabled during debugging. This means that if you
eventually discover a bug in your program and want to correct it, you
must close Valhalla. Do this by pressing CTRL-Q or choosing "Close" in the "File" menu.
After editing a new compilation is required.
