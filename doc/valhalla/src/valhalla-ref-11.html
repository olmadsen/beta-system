<P> A <INX>stack view</INX> is opened by choosing <EM>Current Stack</EM> from the <EM>Display</EM> menu of the Valhalla Universe. The stack view shows the current runtime stack of the debugged process. Note that the stack view only shows stack-frames of the currently attached component.</P>
<UL>
<LI>BETA stack frames displayed as fragmentName: PatternName. Double-clicking on a BETA stack frame opens a code view showing the code referred.
<LI>C stack frames. If an external procedure calls back to BETA, the part of the runtime stack used between the external call from BETA to C and the callback from C to BETA is shown abstractly as [C Stack Frame].
<LI>Components. In the buttom of the stack is a list of the currently existing components. 
</UL>

<P> By double-clicking on the BETA stack frame lines, a code view is opened, displaying the specific code of this stack frame (with the executed imperative being selected).  By right mouse button hold, you gain access to the stack frame object menu.  By selecting the entry, you gain access to the object executing the stack frame. By right clicking on a component you can select either the calling components stack or the calling components calling object. The former will open a stack view and the later a object-view.</P>


<H3>The StackBrowser</H3>
The StackBrowser is opened when you select "Stackbrowser" in the "Windows" menu.<BR>
The StackBrowser combines a Object-View, a Code-View and a Stack-View in one window.<P>
