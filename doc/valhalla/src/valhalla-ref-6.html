<H1><INX>Interaction with Views</INX></H1>
<P> Views are nested inside the Valhalla Universe. Each view has a header consisting of an <INX>iconify</INX> button and a name field.</P>

<P> The different views share many interaction properties, that are described in this section.</P>
<P> Clicking in the name field puts the view on top of all other views. Clicking and dragging the name field moves the view around.</P>
<P> The view may be resized by placing the mouse cursor on the borders of the view (the cursor changes to a cross), and then click-and-drag to resize.</P>

<P> Each view has an associated menu, that is popped up by clicking the right mouse-button in the name field of the view. The contents of that menu depends on whether the type of the view. However, the menu contains in all cases <EM>Close</EM> and <EM>Iconify</EM>. <EM>Close</EM> closes the view, and <EM>Iconify</EM> iconifies the view. By selecting <EM>Deiconify</EM> in the menu popped up by clicking the right mouse-button on the icon, the view is displayed in full again.</P>
