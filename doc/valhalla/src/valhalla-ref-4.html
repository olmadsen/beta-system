<H2><INX>Command Line Arguments</INX> to the Debugged Process and Command Line Editor</H2>
<P> Some applications demand command line arguments in order to execute properly, and others allow command line arguments when being executed.  In order to support debugging of such applications, Valhalla have facilities for handling command line arguments to the debugged process.</P>
<P>
Command Line arguments are specified through the <INX>Command Line Editor</INX>.

<P> Here you can edit and specify the command line arguments to the debugged process before they are handed to the debugged process.</P>
<P> At any time during the debugging of the application, you can invoke the Command Line Editor to edit the command line arguments (by selecting <EM>Command Line...</EM> in the <EM>Edit</EM> menu).  Editing the command line arguments does, however, not directly affect the process being debugged.  The changes are only reflected to the debugged process when it is rerun.</P>
