The BOBS-System is an LALR(1) parser-generator.
This paper a user manual for the system: consisting of a general description of
the system, a reference manual, and a summary of parsing terminology.
These sections can be read without knowledge of parsing theory.

Furthermore, the implementation of the system is described. 
This is done by giving references to literature containing description of  some
of the algorithms used, and by giving abstract algorithms for  other parts of
the system.
This section requires that the reader is familiar with LR-parsing.
