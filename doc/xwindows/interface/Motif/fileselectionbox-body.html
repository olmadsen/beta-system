<B>FileSelectionBox</B><A name="FileSelectionBox.1(814)"></A>: SelectionBox
  (* A FileSelectionBox traverses through directories, views the
   * files and subdirectories in them, and then selects files.
   * 
   * A FileSelectionBox has five main areas:
   * 
   *  + A text input field for displaying and editing a directory
   *    mask used to select the files to be displayed
   * 
   *  + A scrollable list of filenames
   * 
   *  + A scrollable list of subdirectories
   * 
   *  + A text input field for displaying and editing a filename
   * 
   *  + A group of PushButtons, labeled OK, Filter, Cancel, and
   *    Help
   * 
   * One additional WorkArea child may be added to the
   * FileSelectionBox after creation.  The list of filenames, the
   * list of subdirectories, or both can be removed from the
   * FileSelectionBox after creation by using the patterns
   * unmanageFileNames and unmanageSubdirectories.
   * 
   * The directory mask is a string specifying the base directory
   * to be examined and a search pattern.  Ordinarily, the
   * directory list displays the subdirectories of the base
   * directory, as well as the base directory itself and its parent
   * directory.  The file list ordinarily displays all files and/or
   * subdirectories in the base directory that match the search
   * pattern.
   * 
   * The user can select a new directory to examine by scrolling
   * through the list of directories and selecting the desired
   * directory or by editing the directory mask.  Selecting a new
   * directory from the directory list does not change the search
   * pattern.  A user can select a new search pattern by editing
   * the directory mask.  Double clicking on a directory in the
   * directory list initiates a search for files and subdirectories
   * in the new directory, using the current search pattern.
   * 
   * The user can select a file by scrolling through the list of
   * filenames and selecting the desired file or by entering the
   * filename directly into the text edit area.  Selecting a file
   * from the list causes that filename to appear in the file
   * selection text edit area.
   * 
   * The user may select a new file as many times as desired.  The
   * application is not notified until the user takes one of these
   * actions:
   * 
   *  + Selects the OK PushButton
   * 
   *  + Double clicks on an item in the file list The keyboard may
   *    also be used to notify the application, see the relevant Motif
   *    documentation for the machine used.
   * 
   * A FileSelectionBox initiates a directory and file search when
   * any of the following occurs:
   * 
   *  + The FileSelectionBox is initialized
   * 
   *  + The resources dirMask, directory, pattern, or fileTypeMask
   *    are changed
   * 
   *  + The user activates the Filter PushButton
   * 
   *  + The user double clicks on an item in the directory list
   * 
   *  + The application invokes doSearch The keyboard may also be
   *    used to initiate a search, see the relevant Motif
   *    documentation for the machine used.
   * 
   * When a file search is initiated, the FileSelectionBox takes
   * the following actions:
   * 
   *  + Constructs an XmFileSelectionBoxCallbackStruct structure
   *    with values appropriate for the action that initiated the
   *    search
   * 
   *  + Calls the qualifySearchDataProc with the callback structure
   *    as the data input argument
   * 
   *  + Sets directoryValid and listUpdated to False
   * 
   *  + Calls the dirSearchProc with the qualified data returned by
   *    the qualifySearchDataProc
   * 
   * If directoryValid is True, the FileSelectionBox takes these
   * additional actions:
   * 
   *  + Sets listUpdated to False
   * 
   *  + Calls the fileSearchProc with the qualified data returned
   *    by the qualifySearchDataProc
   * 
   *  + If listUpdated is True and the file list is empty, displays
   *    the noMatchString in the file list and clears the selection
   *    text and dirSpec
   * 
   *  + If listUpdated is True and the file list is not empty, sets
   *    the selection text and dirSpec to the qualified dir
   *    returned by the qualifySearchDataProc
   * 
   *  + Sets the directory mask text and dirMask to the qualified
   *    mask returned by the qualifySearchDataProc
   * 
   *  + Sets directory to the qualified dir returned by the
   *    qualifySearchDataProc
   * 
   *  + Sets pattern to the qualified pattern returned by the
   *    qualifySearchDataProc

        * is called with two arguments: the FileSelectionBox widget
