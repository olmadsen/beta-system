<B>Form</B><A name="Form.1(558)"></A>: BulletinBoard
  (* A Form is a BulletinBoard with no input semantics of its own.
   * Constraints are placed on children of the Form to define
   * attachments for each of the child's four sides.  These
   * attachments can be to the Form, to another child widget or
   * gadget, to a relative position within the Form, or to the
   * initial position of the child.  The attachments determine the
   * layout behavior of the Form when resizing occurs.  The
   * following are some important considerations in using a Form:
   * 
   *  + Every child must have an attachment on either the left or
   *    the right.  If not specified, the result depends upon the
   *    value of the rubberPositioning resource.  If the
   *    rubberPositioning resource is False, the child is given an
   *    leftAttachment of XmATTACH_FORM and an leftOffset equal to its
   *    current x value.  If the rubberPositioning resource is True,
   *    the child is given an leftAttachment of XmATTACH_POSITION and
   *    an leftPosition proportional to the current x value divided by
   *    the width of the Form.  In either case, if the child has not
   *    been previously given an x value, its x value is taken to be
   *    0, which places the child at the left side of the Form.
   * 
   *  + If you want to create a child without any attachments, and
   *    then later (e.g., after creating and managing it, but before
   *    realizing it) sets its rightAttachment, you must set its
   *    leftAttachment resource to XmATTACH_NONE at the same time.
   * 
   *  + The the resizable resource resource controls only whether a
   *    geometry request by the child will be granted.  It has no
   *    effect on whether the child's size can be changed because of
   *    changes in geometry of the Form or of other children.
   * 
   *  + Every child has a preferred width, based on geometry
   *    requests it makes (whether they are granted or not).
   * 
   *  + If a child has attachments on both the left and the right
   *    sides, its size is completely controlled by the Form.  It can
   *    be shrunk below its preferred width or enlarged above it, if
   *    necessary, due to other constraints.  In addition, the child's
   *    geometry requests to change its own width may be refused.
   * 
   *  + If a child has attachments on only its left or right side,
   *    it will always be at its preferred width (if resizable,
   *    otherwise at its current width).  This may cause it to be
   *    clipped by the Form or by other children.
   * 
   *  + If a child's left (or right) attachment is set to
   *    XmATTACH_SELF, its corresponding left (or right) offset is
   *    forced to 0.  The attachment is then changed to
   *    XmATTACH_POSITION, with a position that corresponds to x value
   *    of the child's left (or right) edge.  To fix the position of a
   *    side at a specific x value use XmATTACH_FORM or
   *    XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM with the x value as the left (or right)
   *    offset.
   * 
   *  + Unmapping a child has no effect on the Form except that the
   *    child is not mapped.
   * 
   *  + Unmanaging a child unmaps it.  If no other child is
   *    attached to it, or if all children attached to it and all
   *    children recursively attached to them are also all unmanaged,
   *    all of those children are treated as if they did not exist in
   *    determining the size of the Form.
   * 
   *  + When changing the the x resource resource of a child, you
   *    must first set its left attachment to either XmATTACH_SELF or
   *    XmATTACH_NONE.  Otherwise, the request is not granted.  If the
   *    resizable resource is False, the request is granted only if
   *    the child's size can remain the same.
   * 
   *  + A left (or right) attachment of XmATTACH_WIDGET, where the
   *    leftWidget resource (or the rightWidget resource) is 0, acts
   *    like an attachment of XmATTACH_FORM.
   * 
   *  + If an attachment is made to a widget that is not a child of
   *    the Form, but an ancestor of the widget is a child of the
   *    Form, the attachment is made to the ancestor.  All these
   *    considerations are true of top and bottom attachments as well,
   *    with top acting like left, bottom acting like right, y acting
   *    like x, and height acting like width.
