<P> This chapter describes the BETA interface to the Athena widget set. The Athena widget set is build on top of Xt and it contains user interface elements like scrollbars, commands buttons, menus, etc.</P>

<H2> What is the Athena Widget set?</H2>
<P> The Athena Widget Set<A NAME=MARKER-2-132></A> (aw) is developed by MIT<A NAME=MARKER-2-133></A>'s Project Athena<A NAME=MARKER-2-134></A>. It is included in the standard X Window System distribution and is thus universally available. It contains user-interface components like menus, scrollbars, command buttons and a variety of composite widgets.</P>
<P> The Athena widget set was not intended to be complete - it was built mainly for testing and demonstration of Xt. But it has matured into something quite useful, and it is at the time being the only non-commercial universally available widget set.</P>

<H2> Using the AwEnv fragment</H2>
<P> The basic structure of the awenv<A NAME=MARKER-2-135></A> fragment is as follows:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
ORIGIN 'xtenv';
INCLUDE 'athena/awlib';
-- XtEnvLib: attributes -- 
... (* aw widget patterns and other useful patterns *)
AwEnv: XtEnv
  (# &lt;&lt;SLOT awenvlib: attributes&gt;&gt;;
  do INNER
  #)
</PRE>
<P> A typical BETA application using awenv has the following outline:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/Xt/awenv' 
-- program: descriptor -- 
AwEnv
  (# 
  do ...
  #)
</PRE>
<P> When xtenv (the prefix of awenv) starts executing, it does some initializing. Afterwards INNER is called allowing the application program to do its initialization. When the control returns to xtenv, a global event handler is started. When an important user interaction event occurs, xtenv distributes the event to virtual patterns local for the user interface object in question of the application program.</P>
