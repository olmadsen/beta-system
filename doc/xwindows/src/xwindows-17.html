<H1> Simple Athena Patterns</H1>
<P> The following figure illustrates the inheritance hierarchy among the simple Athena widgets. Widgets from XtEnv are shaded gray:</P>

<P> </P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-5></A>
<H1> Simple</H1>
<P> The Simple<A NAME=MARKER-2-156></A> widget is not very useful by itself, as it has no semantics of its own. Its main purpose is to be used as a common superpattern for the other simple Athena widgets. Provides a rectangular area with a setable mouse cursor and special border.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-7></A>
<H1> Label </H1>
<P> A Label<A NAME=MARKER-2-157></A> widget is a text string or bitmap displayed within a rectangular region of the screen. The label may contain multiple lines of characters. The Label widget will allow its string to be left, right, or center justified. Normally, this widget can be neither selected nor directly edited by the user. It is intended for use as an output device only.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-9></A>
<H1> Command</H1>

<P> The Command<A NAME=MARKER-2-158></A> widget is an area, often rectangular, that contains a text label or bitmap image. Those selectable areas are often referred to as 'buttons'. When the pointer cursor is on a button, it becomes highlighted by drawing a rectangle around its perimeter. This highlighting indicates that the button is ready for selection. When pointer button 1 is pressed, the Command widget indicates that it has been selected by reversing its foreground and background colours. When the button is released, the Command widget's virtual pattern callback will be invoked. If the pointer is moved out of the widget before the button is released, the widget reverts to its normal foreground and background colours, and releasing the button has no effect. This behaviour allows the user to cancel an action.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-12></A>
<H1> ListWidget</H1>
<P> The ListWidget<A NAME=MARKER-2-159></A> contains a list of strings formatted into rows and columns. When one of the strings is selected, it is highlighted, and the ListWidget's virtual pattern callback is invoked. Only one string may be selected at a time.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-14></A>
<H1> StripChart</H1>
<P> The StripChart<A NAME=MARKER-2-160></A> widget is used to provide a real time graphical chart of a single value. This widget is used by the xload program to provide the load graph. It will read data from an application, and update the chart at the update interval specified.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-16></A>
<H1> Toggle</H1>
<P> The Toggle<A NAME=MARKER-2-161></A> widget is an area, often rectangular, containing a text label or bitmap image. This widget maintains a Boolean state (e.g. True/False or On/Off) and changes state whenever it is selected. When the pointer is on the button, the button may become highlighted by drawing a rectangle around its perimeter. This highlighting indicates that the button is ready for selection. When pointer button 1 is pressed and released, the Toggle widget indicates that it has changed state by reversing its foreground and background colors, and its virtual method callback is invoked. If the pointer is moved out of the widget before the button is released, the widget reverts to its normal foreground and background colors, and releasing the button has no effect. This behavior allows the user to cancel an action.</P>
<P> Toggle buttons may also be part of a radio group. A radio group<A NAME=MARKER-2-162></A> is a list of at least two Toggle buttons in which no more than one Toggle may  be set at any time. A radio group is identified by any one of its members. </P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-19></A>
<H1> Grip </H1>
<P> The Grip<A NAME=MARKER-2-163></A> widget provides a small rectangular region in which user input events (such as ButtonPress or ButtonRelease) may be handled. The most common use for the Grip widget is as an attachment point for visually repositioning an object, such as the pane border in a Paned widget.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING17-21></A>
<H1> Scrollbar</H1>
<P> The Scrollbar<A NAME=MARKER-2-164></A> widget is a rectangular area containing a slide region and a thumb (also known as a slide bar). A Scrollbar can be used alone, as a value generator, or it can be used within a composite widget (for example, a Viewport). A Scrollbar can be oriented either vertically or horizontally.</P>
<P> When a Scrollbar is created, it is drawn with the thumb in a contrasting color. The thumb is normally used to scroll client data and to give visual feedback on the percentage of the client data that is visible.</P>
<P> Each pointer button invokes a specific action. That is, given either a vertical or horizontal orientation, the pointer button actions will scroll or return data as appropriate for that orientation. Pointer buttons 1 and 3 do not move the thumb automatically. Instead, they return the pixel position of the cursor on the scroll region. When pointer button 2 is clicked, the thumb moves to the current pointer position. When pointer button 2 is held down and the pointer is moved, the thumb follows the pointer.</P>
<P> The pointer cursor in the scroll region changes depending on the current action. When no pointer button is pressed, the cursor appears as a double-headed arrow that points in the direction that scrolling can occur. When pointer button 1 or 3 is pressed, the cursor appears as a single-headed arrow that points in the logical direction that the client will move the data. When pointer button 2 is pressed, the cursor appears as an arrow that points to the thumb.</P>
<P> While scrolling is in progress, the application receives notification through callback virtual patterns. For both discrete scrolling actions, the callback gives the pixel position of the pointer when the button was released. For continuous scrolling, the callback routine gives the current relative position of the thumb. When the thumb is moved using pointer button 2, the callback virtual is invoked continuously. When either button 1 or 3 is pressed, the callback virtual is invoked only when the button is released and the further binding of the callback virtual is responsible for moving the thumb.</P>
