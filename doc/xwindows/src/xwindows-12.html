<H2> Examples using Xt widgets</H2>
<P> The following program illustrates the basic structure of an XtEnv application. It does nothing but popping up a window which is 50 pixels high and 150 pixels wide.</P>

<BETA LIST="generic.bet" SRC="$BETALIB/Xt/demo/xtenv/generic.bet">

<P> In a specialization of XtEnv, a <INX>Core</INX> widget called widget is initialized. This will be a child of toplevel. Values are assigned to some of widget's attributes, whereafter the control returns to XtEnv. In the prefix-part toplevel is realized and XtEnv goes into the basic <INX>event loop</INX>. The realization of <INX>toplevel</INX> results in the popping up of the following window:</P>

<P> The <INX>decoration</INX> of the window - a <INX>titlebar</INX> with the title and a <INX>closebox</INX> - depends on the <INX>window manager</INX> running. The above dump of the window have been made on a Macintosh using the <INX>MacX</INX> X Window System. MacX contains its own window manager. Other window managers may make other decorations of the window like another type of titlebar or putting a resize-box on.</P>
<P> The name used in the titlebar is the name of the application.</P>
<P> Not very many interesting programs can be written using 'pure' XtEnv. The following program illustrates how the low-level <INX>Xlib</INX> calls can be used together with XtEnv, and it also illustrates how the low-level <INX>eventhandler</INX> facilities can be used. The demo program is thus for the advanced programmer. The demo program is an interactive drawing program. Every time the user presses the mouse button, a line is drawn.</P>

<BETA LIST="draw.bet"  SRC="$BETALIB/Xt/demo/xtenv/draw.bet">

<P> The bp object is called every time the user presses the mouse button. The Xlib functions <INX>XDrawLine</INX> and <INX>XDefaultGCOfScreen</INX> are used in the drawing of the line. The program may be used to make drawings like this:</P>

<P> </P>

<P> The above program does not handle <INX>expose events</INX>. If another window is put on top of the above window and afterward moved, the contents of the 'draw' window is erased. The following demo-program is another version of the above program that handles expose-events. It is only necessary to worry about expose-events when drawing by means of low-level Xlib calls.</P>
