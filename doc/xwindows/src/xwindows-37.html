<H2> Other MotifEnv Patterns</H2>
<P> The user may in some situations want to create a shell for a special menu or dialog type. This can be done using the MenuShell and DialogShell respectively. However, because of the wide variety of utility patterns to create menus and dialogs, normally the user will not need to use these two patterns directly.</P>

<UL>
<LI><INX><CODE>MenuShell</CODE></INX>: a custom <INX>OverrideShell</INX> widget. An OverrideShell widget bypasses the window manager when displaying itself. It is designed specifically to contain Popup or Pulldown MenuPanes. Most application writers never encounter this widget if they use the patterns PopupMenu or PulldownMenu, which automatically create a MenuShell widget as the parent of the MenuPane. However, if these patterns are not used, the application programmer must create the required MenuShell. In this case, it is important to note that the type of parent of the MenuShell depends on the type of menu system being built.
<UL>
<LI> If the MenuShell is for the top-level Popup MenuPane, the MenuShell must be created as a child of the widget from which the Popup MenuPane is popped up.
<LI> If the MenuShell is for a MenuPane that is pulled down from a Popup or another Pulldown MenuPane, the MenuShell must be created as a child of the Popup or Pulldown MenuPane.
<LI> If the MenuShell is for a MenuPane that is pulled down from a MenuBar, the MenuShell must be created as a child of the MenuBar.
<LI> If the MenuShell is for a Pulldown MenuPane in an OptionMenu, the MenuShell's parent must be the OptionMenu.
</UL>

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>DialogShell</CODE></INX>: Modal and modeless dialogs use DialogShell as the Shell parent. DialogShell widgets cannot be iconified. Instead, all secondary DialogShell widgets associated with an <INX>ApplicationShell</INX> widget are iconified and de-iconified as a group with the primary widget. A client indirectly manipulates a DialogShell via the different dialog patterns, and it can directly manipulate its BulletinBoard-derived child. Much of the functionality of DialogShell assumes that its child is a BulletinBoard, although it can potentially stand alone.
