<H2> The BETA interface to Xt et. al.</H2>
<P> This report documents the BETA interfaces to 
the X Toolkit <INX><CODE>XtEnv</CODE></INX>, 
to the Athena widget set <INX><CODE>AwEnv</CODE></INX>, 
and to <INX>OSF/Motif</INX> <INX><CODE>MotifEnv</CODE></INX>. 
The interfaces consist of several fragments:</P>

<UL>
<LI><INX><CODE>xlib</CODE></INX>: a procedural interface to the low-level library Xlib. It contains an interface to nearly all the functions in Xlib. The interface is C-like: for most C-functions in Xlib there are corresponding BETA-patterns with the same names and enter/exit parameters corresponding to the C-parameters and return values.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>events</CODE></INX>: Contains BETA interface to X Events. Is included by xlib

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>xtlib</CODE></INX>: a procedural interface to Xt. This fragment includes xlib.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>awlib</CODE></INX>: a procedural interface to Athena. Includes xtlib.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>motiflib</CODE></INX>: a procedural interface to OSF/Motif. Includes xtlib.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>xtenv</CODE></INX>: an interface to Xt where the abstractions of Xt is modelled in BETA in an object-oriented fashion. Includes xtlib.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>awenv</CODE></INX>: an object-oriented interface to Aw. Includes awlib.

<P></P>
<LI> Various utility patterns for awenv.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>motifenv</CODE></INX>: an object-oriented interface to OSF/Motif. Includes <INX>motiflib</INX>. Actually motifenv is just the environment for Motif, the interfaces to the individual widgets and gadgets are placed in separate fragmentgroups, which must be included for use. The fragment <INX>allmotif</INX> includes them all.

<P></P>
<LI><INX><CODE>xsystemenv</CODE></INX>: When concurrency is used by means of the SystemEnv pattern described in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia90-08">[MIA 90-08]</A>, in conjunction with XtEnv, the XSystemEnv pattern located in the xsystemenv fragment should be used.
</UL>
<P> <INX>xtenv</INX>, <INX>awenv</INX>, <INX>motifenv</INX>, and <INX>xsystemenv</INX> are documented in the following chapters of this report. </P>
<P> <INX>xlib</INX>, <INX>xtlib</INX>, <INX>awlib</INX>, and <INX>motiflib</INX> are not documented as there is a one-one correspondence between these fragments and the corresponding C libraries. There should be no need for ordinary users to call any of the low-level routines in these fragments as there are corresponding documented higher-level operations for most of them.</P>
<P> XtEnv, AwEnv, and MotifEnv mostly contain user interface elements like menus, windows, dialog boxes, etc. The Mj&oslash;lner System also contains a library called <INX>Bifrost</INX> with more graphical oriented elements like lines, splines, and circles based on an object-oriented stencil and paint model. This library is documented in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-13">[MIA 91-13]</A>. It Should also be noted, that a platform independent graphical user interface library - Lidskjalv - is now recommended instead of using XtEnv/AwEnv/MotifEnv directly. See <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia94-27">[MIA 94-27]</A> and <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia95-30">[MIA 95-30]</A>.</P>
