<H1> The BETA interface to Xt et. al.</H1>
<P> This report documents the BETA interfaces to the X Toolkit <CODE>XtEnv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-17></A>, to the Athena widget set <CODE>AwEnv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-18></A>, and to OSF/Motif<A NAME=MARKER-2-19></A> <CODE>MotifEnv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-20></A>. The interfaces consist of several fragments:</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>xlib</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-21></A>: a procedural interface to the low-level library Xlib. It contains an interface to nearly all the functions in Xlib. The interface is C-like: for most C-functions in Xlib there are corresponding BETA-patterns with the same names and enter/exit parameters corresponding to the C-parameters and return values.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>events</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-22></A>: Contains BETA interface to X Events. Is included by xlib

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>xtlib</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-23></A>: a procedural interface to Xt. This fragment includes xlib.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>awlib</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-24></A>: a procedural interface to Athena. Includes xtlib.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>motiflib</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-25></A>: a procedural interface to OSF/Motif. Includes xtlib.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>xtenv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-26></A>: an interface to Xt where the abstractions of Xt is modelled in BETA in an object-oriented fashion. Includes xtlib.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>awenv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-27></A>: an object-oriented interface to Aw. Includes awlib.

<P></P>
<LI> Various utility patterns for awenv.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>motifenv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-28></A>: an object-oriented interface to OSF/Motif. Includes motiflib<A NAME=MARKER-2-29></A>. Actually motifenv is just the environment for Motif, the interfaces to the individual widgets and gadgets are placed in separate fragmentgroups, which must be included for use. The fragment allmotif<A NAME=MARKER-2-30></A> includes them all.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>xsystemenv</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-31></A>: When concurrency is used by means of the SystemEnv pattern described in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia90-08">[MIA 90-08]</A>, in conjunction with XtEnv, the XSystemEnv pattern located in the xsystemenv fragment should be used.
</UL>
<P> xtenv<A NAME=MARKER-2-32></A>, awenv<A NAME=MARKER-2-33></A>, motifenv<A NAME=MARKER-2-34></A>, and xsystemenv<A NAME=MARKER-2-35></A> are documented in the following chapters of this report. </P>
<P> xlib<A NAME=MARKER-2-36></A>, xtlib<A NAME=MARKER-2-37></A>, awlib<A NAME=MARKER-2-38></A>, and motiflib<A NAME=MARKER-2-39></A> are not documented as there is a one-one correspondence between these fragments and the corresponding C libraries. There should be no need for ordinary users to call any of the low-level routines in these fragments as there are corresponding documented higher-level operations for most of them.</P>
<P> XtEnv, AwEnv, and MotifEnv mostly contain user interface elements like menus, windows, dialog boxes, etc. The Mj&oslash;lner System also contains a library called Bifrost<A NAME=MARKER-2-40></A> with more graphical oriented elements like lines, splines, and circles based on an object-oriented stencil and paint model. This library is documented in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-13">[MIA 91-13]</A>. It Should also be noted, that a platform independent graphical user interface library - Lidskjalv - is now recommended instead of using XtEnv/AwEnv/MotifEnv directly. See <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia94-27">[MIA 94-27]</A> and <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia95-30">[MIA 95-30]</A>.</P>
