<H1> What is Xt?</H1>

<P> For the C programmer the low-level interface used in programming X Window System applications is a library called Xlib<A NAME=MARKER-2-6></A>. Xlib defines an extensive set of functions that provide complete access and control over the display, windows, and input devices. Although programmers can use Xlib to build applications, this rather low-level interface is tedious and hard to use correctly. It does little to make programming easy.</P>
<P> To simplify development of application programs, the development group behind the X Window System realized that the user-interface elements of a graphical application: scrollbars, commands buttons, menus, etc. should ideally be available ready-made for the programmer, and that the object-oriented style of programming is a desirable programming style when programming such applications. This resulted in a C-library called Xt<A NAME=MARKER-2-7></A> on top of Xlib.</P>

<P> The purpose of Xt is to provide an object-oriented layer that supports user-interface abstractions called widgets. A widget is a reusable, configurable piece of C-code that operates independently of the application except through prearranged interactions. </P>
<P> Xt contains the basic functionality to support widgets, i.e. an architectural model for widgets that allow them to be written and used in an object-oriented fashion. Xt also contains a small core set of widgets.</P>
<P> One of the philosophies behind the X Window System is to be policy-free<A NAME=MARKER-2-8></A>. It does not support any particular user interface style. The X Window System provides mechanisms to support many different interface styles rather than enforcing any one policy. Xt also attempts to be policy-free.</P>

<P> A widget set<A NAME=MARKER-2-9></A> is a collection of widgets build on top of Xt that provide commonly used user-interface components tied together with a consistent appearance and user interface. Several different widget sets from various sources exists. The Athena<A NAME=MARKER-2-10></A> widget set is one example. Others are Motif<A NAME=MARKER-2-11></A> from Open Software Foundation<A NAME=MARKER-2-12></A> (OSF<A NAME=MARKER-2-13></A>) and OPEN WINDOWS<A NAME=MARKER-2-14></A> from Sun<A NAME=MARKER-2-15></A> and AT&amp;T<A NAME=MARKER-2-16></A>.</P>
