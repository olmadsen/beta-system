<P> This chapter describes the BETA interface to the X toolkit (Xt). Xt contains the basic patterns common for many user-interface toolkits build on top of X, but does not contain any higher level user interface elements. It is typically used together with a widget set containing such user interface elements build on top of it. An example of such a widget set is the Athena Widget set. The BETA interface to the Athena Widget set is described in the next chapter. </P>
<P> The following figure illustrates the inheritance hierarchy among the XtEnv widgets:<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></EM></P>

 Actually this figure is not complete: Above Core, two abstract superclasses called XtObject and RectObj exist. These classes should never be used directly by the user and will not be described in detail here. See the <A HREF="interfaces/X11/index.html">Interface Descriptions</A> for details.
