<P> The following is a brief description of the Motif gadgets:</P>


<UL>
<LI><CODE>Gadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-293></A>: a pattern used as a supporting superpattern for other gadget patterns. It handles shadow-border drawing and highlighting, traversal activation and deactivation, and various callbacks needed by gadgets. The difference between a Primitive and a Gadget is, that a gadget i &quot;window-less&quot;, i.e., it uses the window of its parent to draw into. The color and pixmap resources defined by Manager are directly used by gadgets. If one of these resources for is changed for a Manager widget, all of the gadget children within the Manager also change. Gadget is a specialization of RectObj; in contrast Primitive is a specialization of XtObject.

<LI><CODE>LabelGadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-294></A>: Like Label, but uses its parent window for drawing. Almost the same interface as Label. Requires less memory than Label.

<LI><CODE>CascadeButtonGadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-295></A>: Like CascadeButton, but uses its parent window for drawing. Almost the same interface as CascadeButton. Requires less memory than CascadeButton.

<LI><CODE>PushButtonGadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-296></A>: Like PushButton, but uses its parent window for drawing. Almost the same interface as PushButton. Requires less memory than PushButton.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>ToggleButtonGadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-297></A>: Like ToggleButton, but uses its parent window for drawing. Almost the same interface as ToggleButton. Requires less memory than ToggleButton.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>ArrowButtonGadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-298></A>: Like ArrowButton, but uses its parent window for drawing. Almost the same interface as ArrowButton. Requires less memory than ArrowButton.

<P></P>
<LI><CODE>SeparatorGadget</CODE><A NAME=MARKER-2-299></A>: Like Separator, but uses its parent window for drawing. Almost the same interface as Separator. Requires less memory than Separator.

<H1> Examples using Motif Gadgets</H1>

<P> With very few exceptions, a gadget can be used whereever, the
corresponding widget would otherwise be used. The exceptions are:
Gadgets do not support eventhandlers, translations or popup
children. In several of the examples on the following pages, gadgets are used instead
of widgets. Gadgets takes some of the load of the X Window server,
since they do not create their own window, but instead draw in their
parent window. The parents, however, must be prepared to support the
gadgets in this sharing of the window. In general all Motif composites
support gadgets.</P>
