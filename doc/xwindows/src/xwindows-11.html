<H2> Other XtEnv Objects and Patterns</H2>

<H2> Toplevel</H2>
<P> <INX>TopLevel</INX> is the default toplevel widget. It is an instance of ToplevelShell and is automatically initialized by xtenv.</P>

<H2> <INX>Display</INX></H2>
<P> This pattern allows an application to have windows open on more than one workstation at the same time. After a display have been opened, the local item shell of the display can be used as a toplevel widget on that display. When children have been added to shell, the shell must be realized to show the window on screen.</P>

<H2> <INX>Timer</INX></H2>
<P> This pattern allow the application to be notified when a period of time have elapsed, while being able to do other things during that time.</P>

<H2> <INX>WorkProc</INX></H2>
<P> The Workproc-pattern is a means for doing <INX>background processing</INX> while the application is <INX>idle</INX> waiting for an event. After a Workproc has been started, the virtual method job is invoked by xtenv when no events are pending. It is invoked through a BETA component, such that a further binding of job may suspend itself in order not to let the user's response time suffer from time consuming background processing. Next time there are no events pending, job is resumed at the suspended place. More than one Workproc can be started at a time.</P>

<H2> <INX>TranslationTable</INX></H2>
<P> Can be used for the 'advanced' programmer to change the translations used by Xt. See <A HREF=bibliography.html#oreilly90a>[Nye &amp; O'Reilly 90a]</A>, chapter 7 for more details.</P>

<H2> <INX>AcceleratorTable</INX></H2>
<P> Can be used for the 'advanced' programmer to change the accelerators used by Xt. See <A HREF=bibliography.html#oreilly90a>[Nye &amp; O'Reilly 90a]</A>, chapter 7 for more details.</P>

<H2> <INX>RegisteredAction</INX></H2>
<P> Used to register so-called <INX>actions</INX> in Xt. These actions can be used in connection with translations and accelerators. See <A HREF=bibliography.html#oreilly90a>[Nye &amp; O'Reilly 90a]</A>, chapter 7 for more details.</P>

<H2> <INX>StringArray</INX></H2>
<P> This is an array of externally allocated character strings. It is used for various purposes, e.g. to specify the contents of an Athena <INX>ListWidget</INX>.</P>

<H2> <INX>FallbackResources</INX></H2>

<P> Used to specify 'default' resources for an application. These are set before the resource manager of Xt reads user-specified resources, and is thus used to 'fall back' to, if no resources are specified by the user, but will still allow such user specified resources to be supplied</P>

<H2> Options</H2>
<P> Used to specify additional resources to be readable from the command line of the application.</P>

<H2> <INX>ErrorHandler</INX></H2>
<P> An instance of ErrorHandler may be used to catch 
<INX>X errors</INX> as normal BETA runtime errors are caught. That is, a
<INX>dump file</INX> is produced, specifying the dynamic call stack,
when the error occurred, see 
<A HREF="../betarun/beta_dump.html">beta.dump Description</A>. 

ErrorHandler contains two virtual exceptions <INX>xterror</INX> and <INX>xliberror</INX> that can be further bound as any other exception. That is, it is also possible to continue after an X error.</P>

<H2> <INX>WarningHandler</INX></H2>
<P> Like <INX>ErrorHandler</INX>, but for catching Xt warnings only. Contains the virtual <INX>xtwarning</INX>.</P>
