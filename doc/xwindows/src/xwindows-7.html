<H2> <INX>Environment Variables</INX></H2>
<P> The standard <INX>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</INX> environment variable is used in order to link X program correctly. This is given a default value in the Bourne Shell script <INX><CODE>$BETALIB/configuration/env.sh</CODE></INX>, which are used by, e.g., the compiler. Check the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and X specific variables like <INX>MOTIFHOME</INX> and <INX>MOTIFINC</INX> in this file. If they do not correspond to the organization of the libraries at your site, please have your system administrator correct the default values in this script. Notice, however, that normally you can control the values of these variables yourself, without editing the <CODE>env.sh</CODE> script: Values that are lists are just appended to by <CODE>env.sh</CODE>, and variables, that can have just one single value are only set by <CODE>env.sh</CODE>, if not set already. </P>
