<P> This chapter describes the BETA interface to <INX>OSF/Motif</INX>. OSF/Motif is build on top of Xt and it contains user interface elements like scrollbars, buttons, standard dialogs, menus, etc. It also supports multi-font strings and gadgets.</P>



<H2> What is OSF/Motif?</H2>
<P> The Motif widget set contains many user-interface components, including scroll bars, menus, buttons, dialogs, and a wide variety of composite widgets.</P>

<P> The most noticeable characteristics of the Motif Widget set is its three-dimensional (<INX>3-D</INX>) appearance. For instance buttons appear to be pushed in, when the user clicks on them. Most Motif widgets and gadgets draw a border around itself. The top and left sides of this border can be set to one color, and the right and bottom sides to another. By setting these sides to appropriate colors a 3-D shading effect can be obtained. These colors can be set directly by the programmer, but Motif will by default generate appropriate colors automatically based on the background color.</P>

<P> Motif has conventions about the use of its widgets and gadgets, that lead to a consistent look among all applications using Motif. Along with each Motif licence comes an <INX>OSF/Motif Style Guide</INX> with the documentation. This document contains recomandations for application design and layout.</P>

<P> Another notable feature of Motif is its resolution independence mechanism. All sizes and dimensions used by Motif can be specified in terms of pixels, multiples of 1/1000 of an inch, multiples of 1/100 of a point, multiples of 1/100 of a millimeter, or multiples of 1/100 of a font size. The default is to use pixels a the unit for sizes and dimensions.</P>

<P> OSF/Motif also supports some advanced features for internationalization such as language-independent so-called <INX>compound strings</INX>, <INX>keyboard traversal</INX> (moving around widgets and gadgets with keyboard keys rather than the mouse), and <INX>mnemonic</INX> key equivalents for invoking menu items.</P>

<P> OSF/Motif also supplies the <INX>mwm</INX> Motif Window Manager, which is ICCCM compliant; which decorates the windows with title bar, iconify button, help button, resize grips and which has even more features.</P>
