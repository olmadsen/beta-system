<H2> Window facilities</H2>

<P> <INX>window</INX> defines the means for creating windows in applications.  It defines the following important attributes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The events: <INX>onAboutToClose</INX>, <INX>onActivate</INX>, etc. are the facilities for specifying actions to be executed as consequence of user interactions.
<LI><INX>theMenubar</INX> and <INX>menubarType</INX> are the means for associating a menubar with this window.  And <INX>menubarVisible</INX> controls whether the menubar should be visible.
<LI><INX>title</INX> is used for specifying the window title.
<LI><INX>position</INX>, <INX>frame</INX> and <INX>size</INX> are used to control the location of the window.
<LI><INX>floating</INX> controls whether this window will float on top of all other windows.
<LI><INX>show</INX> and <INX>hide</INX> is used to control the visibility of the window.
<LI><INX>showModal</INX> specifies that this window will be shown as a modal window.
<LI><INX>bringToFront</INX>, <INX>bringBack</INX> and <INX>bringBehind</INX> is used to control the stacking order of this window.
<LI><INX>target</INX> is used to control the keyboard focus within this window.
<LI><INX>windowItem</INX> is the central facility for defining the contents of windows. WindowItems can be attached to windows (more details later).
<LI>type controls the appearance of the titlebar of the window: palette, dialog or normal.
<LI><INX>canvas</INX> is a subclass of windowItem, implementing a local coordinate system. Just as windows, more than one windowItem may be associated with a canvas. Canvas function as a mean for grouping windowItems within windows (or other canvasses).
</UL>

<P> <INX>windowItem</INX> is the central class for specifying the contents of windows (and canvasses). The contents of windows are one instance of canvas, simplifying the design.</P>
<UL>
<LI>the events:&Ecirc;<INX>onVisibilityChanged</INX>, <INX>onFrameChanged</INX>, <INX>onFatherFrameChanged</INX>, <INX>onMouseUp</INX>, etc. are the means for specifying actions to be executed as the consequence of user interactions (directly or indirectly).
<LI><INX>father</INX> is a reference to the canvas (and thereby possibly the window), this windowItem is associated with.
<LI><INX>frame</INX>, <INX>position</INX>, <INX>move</INX> and <INX>size</INX> is used to control the location of the windowItem within the father canvas.
<LI><INX>bindLeft</INX>, <INX>bindRight</INX>, <INX>bindBottom</INX> and <INX>bindTop</INX> is used to control the behaviour of this windowItem when the father canvas has changed frame.
<LI><INX>show</INX> and <INX>hide</INX> is used to control whether this windowItem is visible on its father canvas.
<LI><INX>enable</INX> and <INX>disable</INX> is used to control whether this windowItem reacts to mouse and keyboard interactions.
<LI><INX>theCursor</INX> and <INX>cursorType</INX> is used to control the cursor to be displayed within this windowItem.
<LI>drag and resize are facilities to be used for interactive manipulations of this windowItem.
</UL>

<P> <INX>canvas</INX> is the only windowItem subclass that allows attachment of other windowItems. In this respect, canvasses resemble windows (that uses a canvas to contain the windowItems of the window).</P>
