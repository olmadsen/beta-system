<H2> Window facilities</H2>

<P> window<A NAME=MARKER-2-113></A> defines the means for creating windows in applications.  It defines the following important attributes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The events: onAboutToClose<A NAME=MARKER-2-114></A>, onActivate<A NAME=MARKER-2-115></A>, etc. are the facilities for specifying actions to be executed as consequence of user interactions.
<LI>theMenubar<A NAME=MARKER-2-116></A> and menubarType<A NAME=MARKER-2-117></A> are the means for associating a menubar with this window.  And menubarVisible<A NAME=MARKER-2-118></A> controls whether the menubar should be visible.
<LI>title<A NAME=MARKER-2-119></A> is used for specifying the window title.
<LI>position<A NAME=MARKER-2-120></A>, frame<A NAME=MARKER-2-121></A> and size<A NAME=MARKER-2-122></A> are used to control the location of the window.
<LI>floating<A NAME=MARKER-2-123></A> controls whether this window will float on top of all other windows.
<LI>show<A NAME=MARKER-2-124></A> and hide<A NAME=MARKER-2-125></A> is used to control the visibility of the window.
<LI>showModal<A NAME=MARKER-2-126></A> specifies that this window will be shown as a modal window.
<LI>bringToFront<A NAME=MARKER-2-127></A>, bringBack<A NAME=MARKER-2-128></A> and bringBehind<A NAME=MARKER-2-129></A> is used to control the stacking order of this window.
<LI>target<A NAME=MARKER-2-130></A> is used to control the keyboard focus within this window.
<LI>windowItem<A NAME=MARKER-2-131></A> is the central facility for defining the contents of windows. WindowItems can be attached to windows (more details later).
<LI>type controls the appearance of the titlebar of the window: palette, dialog or normal.
<LI>canvas<A NAME=MARKER-2-132></A> is a subclass of windowItem, implementing a local coordinate system. Just as windows, more than one windowItem may be associated with a canvas. Canvas function as a mean for grouping windowItems within windows (or other canvasses).
</UL>

<P> windowItem<A NAME=MARKER-2-133></A> is the central class for specifying the contents of windows (and canvasses). The contents of windows are one instance of canvas, simplifying the design.</P>
<UL>
<LI>the events:&Ecirc;onVisibilityChanged<A NAME=MARKER-2-134></A>, onFrameChanged<A NAME=MARKER-2-135></A>, onFatherFrameChanged<A NAME=MARKER-2-136></A>, onMouseUp<A NAME=MARKER-2-137></A>, etc. are the means for specifying actions to be executed as the consequence of user interactions (directly or indirectly).
<LI>father<A NAME=MARKER-2-138></A> is a reference to the canvas (and thereby possibly the window), this windowItem is associated with.
<LI>frame<A NAME=MARKER-2-139></A>, position<A NAME=MARKER-2-140></A>, move<A NAME=MARKER-2-141></A> and size<A NAME=MARKER-2-142></A> is used to control the location of the windowItem within the father canvas.
<LI>bindLeft<A NAME=MARKER-2-143></A>, bindRight<A NAME=MARKER-2-144></A>, bindBottom<A NAME=MARKER-2-145></A> and bindTop<A NAME=MARKER-2-146></A> is used to control the behaviour of this windowItem when the father canvas has changed frame.
<LI>show<A NAME=MARKER-2-147></A> and hide<A NAME=MARKER-2-148></A> is used to control whether this windowItem is visible on its father canvas.
<LI>enable<A NAME=MARKER-2-149></A> and disable<A NAME=MARKER-2-150></A> is used to control whether this windowItem reacts to mouse and keyboard interactions.
<LI>theCursor<A NAME=MARKER-2-151></A> and cursorType<A NAME=MARKER-2-152></A> is used to control the cursor to be displayed within this windowItem.
<LI>drag and resize are facilities to be used for interactive manipulations of this windowItem.
</UL>

<P> canvas<A NAME=MARKER-2-153></A> is the only windowItem subclass that allows attachment of other windowItems. In this respect, canvasses resemble windows (that uses a canvas to contain the windowItems of the window).</P>
