<P> <center><GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/scrolllisthierarchy.gif></center>

<P> <INX>ScrollList</INX> is a general superpattern realizing the basic functionality of displaying and scrolling in a list of equally sized elements (including facilities for managing single and multiple selections of the elements in the scrollList).</P>
<P> ScrollList contains attributes for inserting and deleting elements as well as for managing the selections (inserting, deleting, scanning and testing).</P>
<P> ScrollList is an abstract pattern that cannot be instantiated.</P>

<P> <INX>TextScrollList</INX> is a minor augmentation of scrollList to make support for scrolling lists of text elements.  Adds three additional attributes: <INX>setText</INX>, <INX>getText</INX> and <INX>style</INX>, which allows for accessing and changing the text and the text style of the individual text elements in the scrollList.</P>
