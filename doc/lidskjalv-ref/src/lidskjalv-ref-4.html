</UL>

<P> The <INX>guienv</INX> library defines the basic facilities of the Lidskjav framework (as described above).  All Lidskjav programs must include at least the guienv fragment.</P>

<P> The <INX>stddialogs</INX> library includes a few predefined patterns for simple, standard dialogs, such as fileSelectionDialog.</P>

<P> The <INX>control</INX> library includes facilities for specifying control interfaceObjects (such as buttons etc.) as described above.</P>

<P> The <INX>fields</INX> library includes facilities for specifying field interfaceObjects (such as static text fields, editable textfields, etc.)</P>

<P> The <INX>figureitems</INX> library includes facilities for specifying basic graphics interfaceObjects (such as lines, ovals, etc.)</P>

<P> The <INX>scrolllist</INX> library includes facilities for specifying scrolling interfaceObjects (such as scrolling lists etc.)</P>

<P> The <INX>graphmath</INX> library includes facilities for graphics computations, such as definition and manipulation of point, rectangle, etc.)</P>

<P> The <INX>graphics</INX> library includes facilities for simple graphics, such as line drawings.</P>

<P> The <INX>styledtext</INX> library includes facilities for working with styled text (i.e text in different fonts and styles).  Currently only available on Macintosh platforms.</P>

<P> The <INX>guienvactions</INX> library defines the actions related to the interfaceObjects, defined in the guienv library (more on actions later).</P>
<P> The <INX>controlsactions</INX> library defines the actions related to the interfaceObjects, defined in the controls library.</P>
<P> The <INX>fieldssactions</INX> library defines the actions related to the interfaceObjects, defined in the fields library.</P>

<P> The <INX>guienvall</INX> library is a very simple library, including all the above libraries.  Used for easy access to the entire suite of facilities in guienv.</P>

<P> The <INX>guienvsystemenv</INX> library is a very simple library that enables concurrency and guienv to work perfectly together.</P>



<H2> Utilities Libraries</H2>
<P> Besides these libraries, the Lidskjalv user interface framework includes a number of utility libraries.  These libraries are located in the utils sub-directory of the Lidskvalv directory tree.  It should be noted, that these libraries contains many very useful facilities, but these libraries are not described in this manual.  Please refer to the <A HREF="interfaces/Utilities/index.html">utilities interface files</A> for details of the very many useful patterns.</P>


<H2> Multimedia Libraries</H2>
<P> Lidskjalv contains two important libraries for controlling multimedia devices (CD players and QuickTime movies) on the Windows and Macintosh platforms (Unix platform not supported).  These facilities are placed in the multimedia sub-directory of the Lidskjalv directory tree. Please refer to the <A HREF="interfaces/Multimedia/index.html">multimedia interface files</A> for details of these useful patterns.</P>


<H2> OpenGL Libraries</H2>
<P> Lidskjalv contains libraries for making OpenGL graphics.  These facilities are placed in the openGL sub-directory of the Lidskjalv directory tree. It should, however, be noted that these libraries are not fully developed, and tested, and is included in this release 'as-is'.  Please refer to the <A HREF="interfaces/OpenGL/index.html">OpenGL interface files</A> for details of these useful patterns.</P>
