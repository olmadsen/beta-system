<H1> Chapter 13:   The guienvall Library</H1>

<P> The guienvall library is a utility fragment, including all the Lidskjalv fragments.  This library might be useful for the first-time user of Lidskjalv, since he then avoids being concerned with in which library a particular facility is defined.  However, please remember, that using the guienvall library will increase your executable, since far to many facilities will be linked into your application.</P>
