<H1>TODO</H1>

<OL>

<LI><CODE>CDman</CODE> moved to doc under the name install.
Must be updated and HTMLized. But must be kept in Word format too for designer??

<LI>Complete bibliography.html. Possibly integrate some of the
references in <A
HREF="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~beta/Papers/References.html">BETA
Reference List</A>

<LI>Convert the remaining manuals from other formats to HTML:
<UL>
<LI>BOBS (LaTeX)
<LI>Teaching (Word)
<LI>Guienv Ref (Word)
<LI>Bifrost Ref (Word)
<LI>Xt Ref (Word)
</UL>

<LI>Fix up manuals converted from Word via FrameMaker and
WebMaker:<BR>
In the process of doing this, I (Peter) have learned various tricks
during the process. This menas that in general the manuals converted
last are better HTML than the manuals converted first. That is the
containers, basiclib and process manuals may need a little more work
than the other manuals. Here is a suggestion of things to check in the
manuals:
<OL>
<LI>Check that BETA code fragments are presented in <CODE>&lt;PRE
CLASS=beta&gt; ... &lt;/PRE&gt;</CODE> with the following
substitutions made in the body:
<CODE><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &amp; -&gt; &amp;amp;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; -&gt; &amp;lt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; -&gt; &amp;gt;<BR>
</CODE>
as described in <A
HREF="../templates/betapresentation.html">doc/templates/betapresentation.html</A>.
This was not automatically done for the first manuals converted.
If you have a number of existing <CODE>&lt;PRE&gt;</CODE> markups
(i.e. without the <CODE>CLASS=beta</CODE>), you may use
<CODE>miadoc-replace9</CODE> in <A
HREF="miadoc-replace.el">doc/admin/miadoc-replace.el</A>. This is an
Etags based Emacs function, which implements appropriate replacements
acros all the involved files.
<LI>Check that demo programs are actually present in the code. At
least for the basiclib manual, some demos where included in Word
<EM>by reference</EM>, and some of these did not survive through the
whole process Word-&gt;FrameMaker-&gt;WebMaker.
<LI>Check that enumerations are marked up with
<CODE>&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;...&lt;/UL&gt;</CODE>.
The Word style Itemize has been automatically converted into this, but
not for the first documents converted. There each line became a
separate paragraph in HTML. Looks bad.
<LI>Maybe some of the first converted manuals has gives rise to too
many HTML files. In the last converted manuals, only Heading 1 and
Heading 2 yielded new files, but in the first converted manuals, all
heading levels yielded new files. Merge HTML files by moving the
contents to another file, then fixing all references to the now
emptied file (use, e.g. <CODE>tags-query-replace</CODE> in Emacs.
<LI>Check images. You may want to add
<CODE>ALIGN={left,middle,right}</CODE>
to the images. Also you may want to make background transparent. Most
often this can be done by the UNIX command <CODE>giftrans -T foo.gif
&gt; xxx.gif; mv xxx.gif foo.gif</CODE>. Also some of the images
converted by WebMaker sometimes look a little "blurred". Fix this by
copying the original images from the original Word files (still
present in <CODE>/users/beta/doc/miadoc/REPOSITORY</CODE>) into a
graphics program, that can save as GIF (e.g. GraphicConverted on
Macintosh).
You may also want to add <CODE>WIDTH</CODE> and <CODE>HEIGHT</CODE>
attributes to image tags to fasten up the browser's layout process.
<LI>Fix references/bibliography. As specified in <A
HREF="rules.html">doc/admin/rules.html</A>
references to "our own stuff" should be via the shared <A
HREF="../bibliography/index.html">doc/bibliography/index.html</A>
file.
Most of the original Word files contained a list of references to
[Madsen 93], [Knudsen 94], [MIA XX-XX]. These should be eliminated
from the "private" Bibliographies (and if the Bibliography is then
empty, ithe file should be completely eliminated). Use, e.g., the
functions <CODE>miadoc-replace8</CODE>, <CODE>miadoc-replace13</CODE>,
and <CODE>miadoc-replace14</CODE> in <A
HREF="miadoc-replace.el">doc/admin/miadoc-replace.el</A>. These are
Etags based Emacs functions, which implements appropriate replacements
acros all the involved files.
<LI>The WebMaker generated files often contain a "local TOC" for
subsections (either in same file as section, or in separate files). I
think these may confuse people, and should probably be removed? They
are marked with <CODE>&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;</CODE> in the HTML.
