<H1>TODO</H1>

<OL>

<LI><CODE>CDman</CODE> moved to doc under the name install.
Must be updated, merged with using on xxx and HTMLized. 

<LI>Complete bibliography.html. Possibly integrate some of the
references in <A
HREF="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~beta/Papers/References.html">BETA
Reference List</A>


<LI>Convert the remaining manuals from other formats to HTML:
<UL>
<LI>BOBS (LaTeX)
</UL>

<LI>Fix up manuals converted from Word via FrameMaker and
WebMaker:<BR>
In the process of doing this, I (Peter) have learned various tricks
during the process. This menas that in general the manuals converted
last are better HTML than the manuals converted first. That is the
containers, basiclib and process manuals may need a little more work
than the other manuals. Here is a suggestion of things to check in the
manuals:
<OL>
<LI>Check that BETA code fragments are presented in <CODE>&lt;PRE
CLASS=beta&gt; ... &lt;/PRE&gt;</CODE> with the following
substitutions made in the body:
<CODE><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &amp; -&gt; &amp;amp;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; -&gt; &amp;lt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; -&gt; &amp;gt;<BR>
</CODE>
as described in <A
HREF="../templates/betapresentation.html">doc/templates/betapresentation.html</A>.
This was not automatically done for the first manuals converted.
<LI>Check that demo programs are actually present in the code. At
least for the basiclib manual, some demos where included in Word
<EM>by reference</EM>, and some of these did not survive through the
whole process Word-&gt;FrameMaker-&gt;WebMaker.
<LI>Check that enumerations are marked up with
<CODE>&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;...&lt;/UL&gt;</CODE>.
The Word style Itemize has been automatically converted into this, but
not for the first documents converted. There each line became a
separate paragraph in HTML. Looks bad.
<LI>Maybe some of the first converted manuals has gives rise to too
many HTML files. In the last converted manuals, only Heading 1 and
Heading 2 yielded new files, but in the first converted manuals, all
heading levels yielded new files. Merge HTML files by moving the
contents to another file, then fixing all references to the now
emptied file (use, e.g. <CODE>tags-query-replace</CODE> in Emacs.
<LI>Check images. You may want to add
<CODE>ALIGN={left,middle,right}</CODE>
to the images. Also you may want to make background transparent. Most
often this can be done by the UNIX command <CODE>giftrans -T foo.gif
&gt; xxx.gif; mv xxx.gif foo.gif</CODE>. There is also a perl script
in <A
HREF="../bin/make_transgif.perl"><CODE>doc/bin/make_transgif.perl</CODE></A>
(assumes <CODE>giftrans</CODE> available). The script allows for
making
transparent background for a number of files in one chunk.

Also some of the images
converted by WebMaker sometimes look a little "blurred". Fix this by
copying the original images from the original Word files (still
present in <CODE>/users/beta/doc/miadoc/REPOSITORY</CODE>) into a
graphics program, that can save as GIF (e.g. GraphicConverted on
Macintosh).
You may also want to add <CODE>WIDTH</CODE> and <CODE>HEIGHT</CODE>
attributes to image tags to fasten up the browser's layout process.
<LI>Fix references/bibliography. As specified in <A
HREF="rules.html">doc/admin/rules.html</A>
references to "our own stuff" should be via the shared <A
HREF="../bibliography/index.html">doc/bibliography/index.html</A>
file.
Most of the original Word files contained a list of references to
[Madsen 93], [Knudsen 94], [MIA XX-XX]. These have been fixed in the
manuals.
Please check remaining references and bibliographies.
<LI>You may also want to rename some of the files, which are named,
e.g. <CODE>basiclib-3.html</CODE>, <CODE>basiclib-4.html</CODE> etc.
to more descriptive names. After the rename, issue an <CODE>etags
*.html</CODE> in your directory and then inside Emacs issue a
<CODE>tags-query-replace</CODE> replacing the old file name with the
new one. Do this for each file renamed. I did this for, e.g., <A
HREF="../bifrost-tut/index.html">doc/bifrost-tut</A>.
</OL>

<LI>You may want to add <EM>image-maps</EM> to improve the usefulness
of your manual. Take a look at <A
HREF="../bifrost-tut/snapshot.html">doc/bifrost-tut/snapshot.html</A>
for an example.

</OL>

More long termed ideas:

<UL>



<LI>Think about support for printing whole manuals

<LI>Possibly make frameset based manuals (toc in left frame), each
page  being a seperate frameset with two frames - one for the
navigation buttons and one for the body. Allows scrolling of
body without losing navigation buttons.

<LI>Define a sequence file for each manual.
From this generate table of contents (HEADING anchors), index
(MARKER anchors), and navigation buttons for each page.

<LI>Fix interface generator to merge in index for manual in the index
generated for interface descriptions.

<LI>Generate List of Figures for all manuals

<LI>Generate list of programs for all manuals

<LI>Find a way to include source (BETA) files into HTML (possibly &lt;OBJECT&gt;)

<LI>Replace footer table with all javascript based version (easier to
maintain):
<PRE>
&lt;script language=javascript src=../javascript/footer.js&gt;
&lt;!--
  footer('Basic Libraries - Reference Manual');
<I>or</I>
  first_footer('Basic Libraries - Reference Manual');
  // --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>

<LI>DOCTYPE should be fixed (currently 3.2):
<CODE><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"></CODE>.
See <A
HREF="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib/catalog">http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib/catalog</A>.

<LI>TYPE missing for all JavaScript calls!

<LI>Fix bin/gram2html to work case-insensitive: HREFs may currently
be in different case than NAME's (c.f. <A HREF="errors.html">errors.html</A>)
Requires a 2-pass algorithm.
