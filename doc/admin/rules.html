<H1>Rules for editing miadoc pages</h1>
Since a lot of people are involved in maintaining the
document pages, a few basic rules must be agreed on:

<UL>

<LI><B>Edit your own copy</B><BR>
Do not edit in any of the places this documentation is
<EM>officially</EM> <A HREF="checked_out.html">checked out</A>.<BR>
Instead get your own copy by
<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;cvs get doc</CODE>
<BR>
This rule is to prevent simultaneously editing and to prevent
external users from experiencing inconsistent files.
<P>

<LI><B>Using a Web editor</B><BR>
If you prefer using a high-level Web editor instead of editing
HTML directly, this is OK.<BR>
<EM>However</EM>, you should only use such an editor for
pages you are the main editor of, and especially not
for pages that are potentionally edited by several people
(like the main <A HREF="../index.html"><CODE>index.html</CODE></A>, 
the <A HREF="document-list.html"><CODE>document-list.html</CODE></A>,
etc.).
<BR>
The problem with using a Web editor with pages that can be
edited by other people is, that the Web editors tend to do a complete
rewite of the HTML mark-up (e.g som uses uppercase tags, others
lowercase; some eidtors clutter the HTML with <CODE>&amp;nbsp;</CODE>
etc.).<BR>
This gives raise to huge virtually unsolvable CVS conflicts.
<P>

<LI><B>Use relative paths in URLs</B><BR>
Use releative paths in all links to other parts of this documentation.
That is use, e.g.,<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;IMG SRC="../images/warning.gif&gt;</CODE><BR>
instead of<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;IMG SRC="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~beta/doc/images/warning.gif&gt;</CODE><BR>
This is to make <CODE>doc</CODE> as self-contained as possible, since
it will at some time be packed onto a CD from which a user should be
able to browse the pages locally.
<P>

<LI><B>Add GIF files as binary</B><BR>
This is more a hint than a rule: GIF files and other binary files must
be added as such to CVS:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;cvs add -kb foo.gif</CODE><BR>
See 
<A HREF="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~devise/Internal/beta/cvs_use.html#binary">
CVS: Handling Binary Files
</A>
for further details.
<P>

<LI><B>Build Interface Descriptions on UNIX</B><BR>
Again just a hint: The interface files are build on UNIX
by issuing<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;make</CODE><BR>
from the main directory of this documentation. 
This build involves Bourne Shell scripts, which will only work on UNIX.
