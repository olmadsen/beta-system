<H1> Multi-User Shared Persistent Store</H1>

The multi-user shared persistent store makes it possible for two or
more programs (clients) to acces the same persistent store. Access to
the store has to be mediated through a server. The shared persistent store
consists of a number of frameworks that may be used to build clients
and servers. A client/server may contain part of the multi-user
functionality or all of it.
