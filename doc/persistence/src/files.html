<H2> Files used for storing objects</H2> 

<P> The name parameter to the create, openRead and openWrite
operations in the persistentstore pattern is interpreted as a
directory name relative to the current directory of the process. When
creating a new persistent store, this directory is created along with
the file db.  (Note, the old persistent store creates the files locg,
oinx and data.) For deleting the files making up a persistent store,
the deletePersistentStore pattern is available.</P>
