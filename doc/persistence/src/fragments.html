<H1> Fragments and Compiled Code</H1>

<P> A BETA pattern <A NAME=MARKER-2-13></A>is declared in some
fragment <A NAME=MARKER-2-14></A>of the BETA fragment system. The
fragment in turn is part of a fragment group<A NAME=MARKER-2-15></A>,
corresponding to a BETA source file. For a description of the fragment
system, see <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia90-2">[MIA
90-2]</A>. To identify the pattern from which a persistent object was
created, the object has a reference to the fragment in which the
pattern is declared. The fragment is unique in the sense that it is
the version used for generating the code that instantiated the
object. In order to load an object into the memory of some program
execution, the program loading the object must be compiled from and
linked with the same version of the fragment from which the object was
originally created. Note that this does not prevent exchange of
objects between different platforms, since it is the fragments that
must correspond, not the compiled code<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE
HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></EM>.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The current implementation does NOT check if the fragments used for
creating a persistent object has been changed since the object was
created. It is currently the responsibility of the user to keep track
of this. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> It should be obvious that changes to a fragment may cause
inconsistencies with previously generated persistent objects. Neither
is it allowed to change other fragments within the same fragment
group.</P> <P> The fragment used for generating a persistent object is
currently identified using the name without path of the fragment group
in which the pattern is declared. This means that a BETA program using
persistence cannot contain two source files with the same name. If
this restriction is violated, the program will stop with an error
message as soon as the first persistent store is opened. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Multiple equally named BETA source files are not allowed when using
persistence and distribution libraries.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The above problems related to the unique identification of
patterns will be avoided in future versions of the persistent
store.</P>

<HR>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-2>[2] </A> The current version of the persistent
 store does not support object exchange between little and big endian
 machines.
