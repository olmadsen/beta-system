<H1> Objects and Patterns </H1>
<P> An object generated as an instance of a pattern is only meaningful as an instance of that pattern. Consider the following example: </P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
P: (# ... #);
R: ^P;

&amp;P[] -&gt; R[]; .... (* Save R *)
</PRE>
<P> The object referenced by R is an instance of P. When this object is later read by a program, it must be interpreted by that program execution as an instance of P. </P>
<P> It is not enough that the program reading the object has a declaration of a pattern P which has the same structure as the pattern P which was used to generate the object. It must be the very same pattern. </P>

<P> In order for this to work, it is necessary to give a new interpretation to the notion of betaenv<A NAME=MARKER-2-12></A>. This new interpretation is described in the next section. Before doing this we will shortly discuss what it means for objects to be instances of the same pattern.</P>
<P> Consider the following object descriptor:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
(# T: (#  c: @ integer;
          A: (# b: @integer do c-&gt;b #);
          X: @ A;
          Y: @ A
      #);
   V: @ T;
   W: @ T
#)
</PRE>

<P> The outermost object has two internal objects V and W which are instances of the pattern T. Each of V and W has internal attributes c, A, X and Y. The attributes of V are different from the attributes of W. This should be obvious for c, X and Y, since they occupy different storage locations in V and W respectively. The pattern attribute A of V is also different from the pattern attribute A of W. The reason is that an instance of V.A is enclosed by V and may therefore refer to attributes of V -- V.A is said to have origin in V. The pattern W.A is an attribute of W and may refer to attributes of W -- W.A has origin in W. An instance of V.A is therefore NOT an instance of W.A. </P>
<P> The objects V.X and V.Y are thus instances of the same pattern V.A. Similarly the objects W.X and W.Y are instances of the same pattern W.A.</P>
