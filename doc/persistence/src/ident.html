<H2> Persistent store identification and cross store references</H2>

<P> The persistent store identifies objects using a two-part object <INX>id</INX>, each part being a 32 bit integer. The first part identifies the persistent store in which the object is saved, and the second part is a unique identification of the object within that store. Currently the persistent store id is simply the system time (in seconds) when the store was created. A persistent store containing references to other persistent store thus maintains a mapping from these creation times to the full pathname of the persistent stores, in order to be able to call the openpstore virtual with the correct pathname.</P>
<P> Unfortunately this identification is not entirely unique. The persistent store kernel ensures that no two stores created by the same process gets the same <INX>creationtime</INX>, but there is currently no way to ensure that different processes do not create persistent stores with the same creation time. A process simultaneously opening two persistent stores with the same creation time will therefore in the best case receive wrong alreadyOpen exceptions, and in the worst case wrong in-memory object graphs may be created.</P>
<P> In future versions of the persistent store, this problem will be solved by using an alternative identification scheme.</P>
