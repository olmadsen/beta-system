<H2> Restrictions</H2>

<P> In the single-user case at most one program at a time should open
a given persistent store in order to avoid problems with concurrent
access.

<p>
If multiple programs are going to use the same persistent store, the
multi-user version should be used.

<P> As already mentioned, application programs exploiting object
persistence should not include multiple source files with the same
name.</P>

<P> Component <INX>objects</INX>, i.e. objects with their
own execution stack, are not allowed in the transitive closure of
persistent roots. If components are met during a checkpoint operation,
the program will terminate with an error message.</P>
