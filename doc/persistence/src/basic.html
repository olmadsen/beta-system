<H2>Persistent Object</H2>
<P> A <em>persistent object</em> <A NAME=MARKER-2-6></A>is an object
that is saved on secondary storage during a program execution and thus
survives the program execution in which it was created. A persistent
object may be read by another program execution. Any BETA object can
in principle be persistent. In the current implementation, the
execution state (i.e. <em>component stacks</em><A
NAME=MARKER-2-7></A>) is not saved. Furthermore, for certain types of
objects it may not be meaningful to make them persistent. This is
e.g. the case with user interface objects generated by libraries such
as xtenv, bifrost and macenv. Xtenv objects may e.g. have partial
state information about windows, widgets, etc., but this information
will not be sufficient to restore the screen.</P>

<H2>Transitive Closure</H2>
<P> By default, when an object is made persistent, all objects that
can be reached through references are also made persistent. This
includes statically enclosing objects<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE
HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></EM>. The set of objects that can be
reached from an object in this way is called the <em>transitive
closure</em> <A NAME=MARKER-2-8></A>of the object. </P>

<H2>Persistent Store</H2>
<P> Persistent objects are saved in a <em>persistent store</em><A
NAME=MARKER-2-9></A>, which is a collection of persistent objects. A
persistent store has a name. In the current implementation, the name
of a persistent store is the name of a file system directory
containing the files making up the persistent store. Several
persistent stores may exist and references between objects in
different persistent stores are supported. A persistent store is
itself a BETA object with a number of attributes. </P>

<H2>Persistent Root</H2>
<P> An object may be pointed out to become a <em>persistent
root</em><A NAME=MARKER-2-10></A> by means of the put operation on the
persistent store. A persistent root must be given a logical name in
the form of a text string. On checkpoint <A NAME=MARKER-2-11></A>time,
all objects reachable from persistent roots are saved in the
persistent store.</P>
