<H1>BETART Environment variable documentation (DEBUG)</H1>

This page is a supplement to the general
<EM>BETART Environment variable documentation</EM>
(see <A
HREF="../BETART.html"><CODE>doc/betarun/BETART.html</CODE></A>).
<P>
This page describes the additional entries that are available when a
program has been linked with the debug runtime system (<CODE>beta -s
13 ...</CODE>).

<H2>3. Debug entries</H2>

<PRE>
Boolean-entries:

        StatAOA		Print detailed information on garbage collection
			in  the  adult object area during execution.

	DebugIOA	Perform extra consistency check during IOAGc

	CheckHeap	Scan IOA, AOA, LVRA and perform consistency check
			on each object found in these heaps. The scan
			is done upon entry and exit of almost every
			RTS routine (technically each time Ck() is called).
			Use a SMALL heap if you enable this entry, otherwise
			the program will run VERY slowly!

	StopAtIllegal	Force a break if the Illegal() routine is called.
			In general Illegal() will be called whenever
			a consistency check in RTS fails.

	DebugAlloI	Print prototype value and name of each object
			allocated by AlloI.

	DebugCBFA	Perform extra consistency check during CBFA
			operations

	DebugAOA	Perform extra consistency check during AOAGc
			and other AOA operations (like AOA allocation)

	DebugAOAtoIOA	Perform extra consistency checks and tracing
			during AOAGc and other AOAtoIOA related operations 

	DebugAOAtoLVRA	Perform extra consistency checks and tracing
			during AOAGc and other AOAtoLVRA related operations 

	DebugLVRA	Perform extra consistency check during LVRAGc
			and other LVRA operations (like LVRA allocation)

	DebugStack	Print out verbose information on stack
			traversals during GC	

	DebugValhalla

	DebugAll	Sets: DebugIOA DebugAOA DebugLVRA
			DebugStack DebugCBFA

	DebugMT		Enable tracing of MT specific code.
			Only for MT betarun.

	DebugSockets	Print debug info from the socket C-layer that
			the process library and valhalla uses.

	InfoLabels
	DebugLabels	Print out debug information on label table
			initialization (gentle and verbose
			respectively).

	TraceGroup	Trace GroupName()

	TraceDump	Trace DisplayBetaStack()
	
	TraceCodeentry	Trace search for prefix in ObjectDescription

Integer-entries:

	DebugStackAtGcNum
			Set DebugStack when IOAGc is invoked
			the specified number of times.

	IOAbytes	IOA size in bytes
