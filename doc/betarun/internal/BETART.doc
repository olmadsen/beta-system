BETART Environment variable documentation.
------------------------------------------

There are 3 sections in this document. The first one
describes BETART in general, the second sefction describes
general BETART entries, whereas the third section
describes entries that are only available when the
program has been linked with debug runtime system.

1. Introduction
---------------

BETART is used to set various characteristics of the run-
time  system.   The specification consists of a list of
entries, separated by ':' (colon).  Colon in the begin-
ning  and  at  the end of the BETART value is optional.
The specification ignores case except for the  case  of
the string-entry values.

Entries may appear more than once in BETART.  The  last
specification will in this case be used.  The semantics
of the different BETART entries are given below.

There are three types of entries:  boolean-,  integer-,
and string-entries.

Example of usage:
    setenv BETART "InfoIOA:IOA=1024:InfoFile=info.dump"
or alternatively
    setenv BETART "InfoIOA:IOA#1024:InfoFile=info.dump"

2. General entries
------------------

 Boolean-entries:
      The default values for  all  boolean  entries  are
      false.  Mentioning  the  boolean entries in BETART
      sets its value to true.
      Boolean entries have the form <entry>, where  <en-
      try> is one of:

      Info      Print information about heap sizes  etc.
                at startup.

      InfoIOA   Print information on garbage  collection
                in  the infant object area during execu-
                tion.

      InfoAOA   Print information on garbage  collection
                in  the  adult object area during execu-
                tion.

      InfoLVRA  Print Information on garbage  collection
                in  the large value repetition area dur-
                ing execution.

      InfoCBFA  Print  information  about  the  callback
                function area during execution.

      InfoLVRAAlloc
                Print information on allocation  in  the
                large  value repetition area during exe-
                cution.

      InfoHeapUsage
	        Print summary of complete heap memory
		usage at various points during execution.
		Notice, that this will not be the complete
		memory usage for the process, since the
		code and and data segments as well as 
		various internal tables also use memory.

      InfoAll   Sets all  Info-entries:  Info,  InfoIOA,
                InfoAOA,  InfoLVRA, InfoCBFA, and InfoL-
                VRAAlloc.

      QuaCont   Continue execution after runtime  detec-
                tion of qualification error in reference
                assignment.

 Integer-entries:
      These   have   the   form   <entry>=<value>,    or
      <entry>#<value>,  where <entry> is one of the fol-
      lowing, and <value> is any positive  integer.  The
      default values are noted in parenthesis below:

      IOA       The size in Kb of the infant object area
                (Default: 512).

      IOAPercentage
                The minimum free fraction in percent  of
                the  infant object area. (Legal range: 3
                to 40, default: 10).

      IOANumSlices
		Number of slices to divide IOA into.
		Only for MT betarun.
		If both IOANumSlices and IOASliceSize are set,
		the one set last will be used.

      IOASliceSize
		Size of each slice in IOA.
		Only for MT betarun.
		If both IOANumSlices and IOASliceSize are set,
		the one set last will be used.

      AOA       The size in Kb of one block in the adult
                object area (Default: 512).

      AOAMinFree
                The minimum free area in Kb in the adult
                object  area.  If less than this size is
                free after an  AOA  garbage  collection,
                then  the  next  allocation  in AOA will
                cause  a  new  block  to  be  allocated.
                Please  note  that it is only meaningful
                to specify one of AOAMinFree and AOAPer-
                centage  (below),  because  they specify
                conflicting behaviour for allocation  in
                AOA. (Default: 100).

      AOAPercentage
                The minimum free fraction in percent  of
                the adult object area. If less than this
                fraction is free after  an  AOA  garbage
                collection,  then the next allocation in
                AOA will cause a new block to  be  allo-
                cated. Please note that it is only mean-
                ingful  to  specify  one  of  AOAMinFree
                (above)  and AOAPercentage, because they
                specify conflicting behaviour for  allo-
                cation  in  AOA.  (Legal range: 3 to 97,
                default: 0, i.e., AOAMinFree is used).

      LVRA      The default size in Kb of one  block  in
                the  large  value  repetition  area (De-
                fault: 512).

      LVRAMinFree
                The minimum free area in Kb in the large
                value  repetition  area.   If  less than
                this size is free after an LVRA  garbage
                collection,  then the next allocation in
                LVRA will cause a new block to be  allo-
                cated. Please note that it is only mean-
                ingful to specify one of LVRAMinFree and
                LVRAPercentage   (below),  because  they
                specify conflicting behaviour for  allo-
                cation in LVRA. (Default: 200).

      LVRAPercentage
                The minimum free fraction in percent  of
                the large value repetition area. If less
                than this fraction is free after an LVRA
                garbage  collection, then the next allo-
                cation in LVRA will cause a new block to
                be  allocated.  Please  note  that it is
                only meaningful to specify one of  LVRA-

                MinFree  (above) and LVRAPercentage, be-
                cause they specify conflicting behaviour
                for  allocation in LVRA. (Legal range: 3
                to 97, default: 0, i.e., LVRAMinFree  is
                used).

      CBFA      The size in Kb of one block in the call-
                back function area (Default: 1).

 String-entries:
      These   have   the   form   <entry>=<value>,    or
      <entry>#<value>,  where <entry> is one of the fol-
      lowing, and <value> is  any  string.  The  default
      values are noted in parenthesis below:

      InfoFile  Name of file on which to write all  this
                information (Default: stderr).


3. Debug entries
----------------

Boolean-entries:

        StatAOA		Print detailed information on garbage collection
			in  the  adult object area during execution.

	DebugIOA	Perform extra consistency check during IOAGc

	CheckHeap	Scan IOA, AOA, LVRA and perform consistency check
			on each object found in these heaps. The scan
			is done upon entry and exit of almost every
			RTS routine (technically each time Ck() is called).
			Use a SMALL heap if you enable this entry, otherwise
			the program will run VERY slowly!

	StopAtIllegal	Force a break if the Illegal() routine is called.
			In general Illegal() will be called whenever
			a consistency check in RTS fails.

	DebugAlloI	Print prototype value and name of each object
			allocated by AlloI.

	DebugCBFA	Perform extra consistency check during CBFA
			operations

	DebugAOA	Perform extra consistency check during AOAGc
			and other AOA operations (like AOA allocation)

	DebugAOAtoIOA	Perform extra consistency checks and tracing
			during AOAGc and other AOAtoIOA related operations 

	DebugAOAtoLVRA	Perform extra consistency checks and tracing
			during AOAGc and other AOAtoLVRA related operations 

	DebugLVRA	Perform extra consistency check during LVRAGc
			and other LVRA operations (like LVRA allocation)

	DebugStack	Print out verbose information on stack
			traversals during GC	

	DebugValhalla

	DebugAll	Sets: DebugIOA DebugAOA DebugLVRA
			DebugStack DebugCBFA

	DebugMT		Enable tracing of MT specific code.
			Only for MT betarun.

	DebugSockets	Print debug info from the socket C-layer that
			the process library and valhalla uses.

	InfoLabels
	DebugLabels	Print out debug information on label table
			initialization (gentle and verbose
			respectively).

	TraceGroup	Trace GroupName()

	TraceDump	Trace DisplayBetaStack()
	
	TraceCodeentry	Trace search for prefix in ObjectDescription

Integer-entries:

	DebugStackAtGcNum
			Set DebugStack when IOAGc is invoked
			the specified number of times.

	IOAbytes	IOA size in bytes
