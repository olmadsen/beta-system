<P> In this tutorial, the program record will be used as an example. This program consists of the files</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
~beta/debugger/demo/record
~beta/debugger/demo/recordlib
</PRE>
<P> and uses</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
~beta/containers/hashTable
</PRE>
<P> The files record and recordlib are listed in appendix A. To get hands-on experience using Valhalla, you should copy record and recordlib to a directory of your own, compile them, and then read the tutorial while strolling along on your own workstation:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
&gt; cd ~beta/debugger/demo
&gt; cp record* myDir
&gt; cd myDir
&gt; beta record
</PRE><BR>Or on windows:
<PRE CLASS=beta>
&gt; copy %BETALIB\demo\beta\record* myDir
&gt; cd myDir
&gt; beta record
</PRE CLASS=beta>

It is not neccessary to compile the program, you can also do that from within the Mjolner tool.
<P> Start the Mjolner tool by typing:
<PRE CLASS=beta>
mjolner
</PRE>
<P> at the UNIX prompt or selecting the icon if you are using a Window system. Open the record example (could be specified at commandline). If you have not compiled the record.bet program allready select "Compile record" in the "Compile/Run" menu. When you have a compiled program, select "Debug recode" in the "Compile/Run" menu. Valhalla is not started. It will initialy perform a check of all involved files, this can take from a few seconds to a minut depending on program size and your computer. Valhalla will then open the Valhalla Universe.<P>
