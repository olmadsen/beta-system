<P> In this tutorial, the program record will be used as an
example. This program consists of the files</P> 
<BETA>
~beta/debugger/demo/record
~beta/debugger/demo/recordlib
</BETA>
<P> and uses</P>
<BETA>
~beta/containers/hashTable
</BETA>
<P> The files record and recordlib are listed in appendix A. To get hands-on experience using Valhalla, you should copy record and recordlib to a directory of your own, compile them, and then read the tutorial while strolling along on your own workstation:</P>
<BETA>
> cd ~beta/debugger/demo
> cp record* myDir
> cd myDir
> beta record
</BETA>
<BR>Or on windows:
<BETA>
> copy %BETALIB\demo\beta\record* myDir
> cd myDir
> beta record
</BETA>

It is not neccessary to compile the program, you can also do that from within the Mjolner tool.
<P> Start the Mjolner tool by typing:
<BETA>
mjolner
</BETA>
<P> at the UNIX prompt or selecting the icon if you are using a Window system. Open the record example (could be specified at commandline). If you have not compiled the record.bet program allready select "Compile record" in the "Compile/Run" menu. When you have a compiled program, select "Debug recode" in the "Compile/Run" menu. Valhalla is not started. It will initialy perform a check of all involved files, this can take from a few seconds to a minut depending on program size and your computer. Valhalla will then open the Valhalla Universe.<P>
