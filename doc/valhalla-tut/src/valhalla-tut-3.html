<P> The Debugger in the Mjolner System is called Valhalla.<Br> 
The user interface of Valhalla  consists of a main window containing a menu and a number of different windows (views) displaying different aspects of the debugged program (called the Valhalla Universe). The <INX>Valhalla Universe</INX> is a top-level window, containing different internal windows for displaying different aspects of the execution state of the debugged process. Below a very short description of the different window types in the Valhalla Universe is given before we go on to describe how to get started using Valhalla.</P>
