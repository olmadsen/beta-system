<H1><INX>Menu Description</INX></H1>

The following describes the menus of a hypothetic tool.
<BR>
In HTML this is done using a <EM><INX>definition list</INX></EM>, and
by tagging each menu item with 
<CODE>&lt;STRONG class="<INX>menuitem</INX>"&gt;...&lt;/STRONG&gt;</CODE>.
In a browser that does not know about style sheets, this will behave 
as an ordinary bold'ing tag, but when a style sheet is in effect,
we can make it look quite different - much like a GIF screen dump
of the actual menua item - but it's pure HTML (:-).
<P>
We have also included the menu-item in the alphabetic index
by using the &lt;INX&gt;...&lt;/INX&gt; tag around the menuitem
definition.
This will make the menu item appear in blue, to indicate thet it is indexed.

<H2><A NAME="filemenu">File Menu</A></H2>

<DL>
<DT><INX><STRONG class="menuitem">Open...</STRONG></INX>
<DD>This could bring up the dialog in the <A
HREF="#FIG_OpenDlg">figure</A> below. This is an application of the
&lt;FIG&gt;...&lt;/FIG&gt; tag, supplied by <A
HREF="../admin/makedoc.html">makedoc</A>.

<P style="text-align:center>
<FIG ID=OpenDlg LIST="Open Dialog">
<GIF SRC="images/opendialog.gif" ALT="Open Dialog">
</FIG>
</P>

<DT><INX><STRONG class=menuitem>Save</STRONG></INX>
<DD>This will save the current document to disk.<BR>
I could tell a lot more about the saving procedure
if I knew exactly what tool this manual actually describes,
but I typed in this text anyway, so that it is seen how multiple lines
of description looks in this definition list.
