<H2>On the FrontBase interface</H2>
<P>
At present time the FrontBase interface in Beta is available on the following platforms:
Solaris and Linux
</P>
<P>
Although FrontBase is also available for Windows this is not supported by the Beta interface. The client library supplied by Frontbase requires Apple's WebObjects.
</P>

<H2>Downloading and installing FrontBase</H2>
<P>
You can download FrontBase at <pre>http://www.frontbase.com</pre>
(push download at the top of the screen and follow the instructions given).


<P><B>Installing FrontBase on Solaris:</B><BR>
Log on as 'root', and type the following:
<BETA>
tar -xvf <the .tar file just downloaded> 
sh install.sh 
</BETA>

<P>
<B>Installing FrontBase on RedHat Linux:</B><BR>
Log on as 'root', and type the following:
<BETA> 
rpm -i <the .rpm file just downloaded> 
</BETA> 
      

<H2>Creating databases and users using the sql92 tool</H2>
sql92 is a small tool included in the FrontBase installation. By default it is located in <pre>FrontBase/bin/sql92</pre>

A small example:
start sql92 and type the following:
<beta>
create database firstdb;
connect to firstdb user _system;
create user firstuser;
disconnect current;
connect to firstdb user firstuser;
disconnect current;
</beta>

<H2>Communicating with FrontBase from a Beta program:</H2>
<p>Almost everything is done the same way as when communicating with Oracle, ODBC etc.</p>
The two major differences:
<ul>
<li>The Beta program must have its ORIGIN set to <pre>'~beta/betadbc/betadbc-frontbase'</pre>
<li>The Beta program must select the host on which the FrontBase server is running before opening a connection. Selecting the host is done by using <pre>&lt;your connection&gt;.<INX>selecthost</INX></pre>
</ul>
<p>Please note that shared variables is currently not possible when using the FrontBase interface. Suggested workaround: build your SQL statement dynamically instead.</p>

A small example:
<BETA>
ORIGIN '~beta/betadbc/betadbc-frontbase';
-- program: Descriptor --
(#
   frontbaseCon: @Connection; 
   stmt: @frontbaseCon.DirectSQLStatement; 

   do
   'brage.mjolner.dk' -> frontbaseCon.selecthost;
   ('firstdb','firstuser','')->frontbaseCon.open;

   'create table Students("Name" varchar(100), "Age" integer);'->stmt.open; 
   stmt.execute;
   stmt.close;
   frontbaseCon.close;
#)
</BETA>
