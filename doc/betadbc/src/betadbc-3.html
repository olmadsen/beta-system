<P> This document describes the BetaDBC (Beta DataBase Connectivity) library for communicating with relational databases using SQL (Structured Query Language, [Date 93]). The library implements the pattern connection used to model connections to relational databases. This pattern contains patterns for querying and manipulating relational databases. Additional support for transactions may be added by including the fragment transactions. Scrolling cursors are implemented in the fragment scrollingresultset.</P>
