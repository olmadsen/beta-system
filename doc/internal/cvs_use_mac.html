<h1> Using Cvs on Macintosh </h1>


<Table>

<TD width=50></TD>

<TD width=450>
 
<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
The cvs client is supported on both powermac and 86k mac. This page is
a guide on how to download and install cvs on your mac. It is very
important that you read the "known problems" section, before using
maccvs.

<p>
The cvs client is use from within MPW. The synopsis is the usual, for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE> cvs get guienv </BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2> Requirements </h2>

<OL>

<LI> You must be a member of the netgroup `beta' You can check whether
you are in the group by executing the following in the shell:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> ypmatch beta group </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE> If you are
not in the group, contact the <A HREF="mailto:staff@daimi.aau.dk">staff</A>.

<P>

<LI>You must have an "~/.rhosts" file in your home-directory on unix. It
should contain a line with the name of the mac, and your unix username. the
file must have permissions "600" = "-rw-------", so that only the user can
read it. Create it with a unix texteditor, as it should contain unix
linefeeds. An example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
saljut beta
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The above line is added to the /users/beta/.rhosts file. If you use
the beta username, this is where you should add your own line.

<P>

<LI> The owner name of your mac must be the above username. Change
this in the "Sharing Setup" control panel.


</OL>

<h2> Software </h2>

<UL>

<li> MPW: You can get this from the ETO disc.

<P>

<li> MacPerl: Perl for macintosh. This is included in the package you
are going to download.

<P>

<li> MacCvs application and scripts, also included in the package.

</UL>

Download the package: <a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~devise/internal/beta/maccvs.sea.hqx"> Maccvs Installation </a>

<P>

<h2> Installation </h2>

<OL>

<li> Doubleclick on the downloaded self extracting archive to extract
the files.

<P>

<li> Doubleclick on the file "Mac_Perl_513r2_tool" to extract the
MacPerl folder required for your macintosh.

<P>

<li> Drag userstartup&middot;perl and userstartup&middot;cvs into your MPW folder.

<P>

<li> Start MPW, and select the MacPerl folder and the MacCvs folder
when asked to do so. There is two MacCvs folders, one for power mac
and one for 68k macs. Be sure to choose the correct one for your
machine.

</OL>

<h2> Known problems </h2>

<UL>

<li> The file names cannot be longer than 26 characters.

<P>

<li> The "cvs commit" command requires the "-m" option and <em>one</em> word as
argument - not even quoted strings will do - (e.g. <code>cvs com -m
Fixed_Mac_error</code>, but <em>not</em> <code>cvs com -m "Fixed Mac
error"</code>), otherwise the application will crash.

<P> 

<li>There is currently an error in the <code>userstartup&middot;cvs</code>
script: It adds an extra space after the last comma in the setup of the
<code>commands</code> variable. This will prevent the MPW shell from finding
programs in the current directory. Fix the error in the startup file and
restart MPW. Of course the package should be updated...

<p>
<li>The <code>Maccvs</code> runs as a background application. If you interrupt
a cvs command in MPW, you may have to restart the computer to get CVS to
work again, depending on what the background application was doing at the time
of the interrupt.
