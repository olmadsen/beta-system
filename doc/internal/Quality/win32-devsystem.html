<H1>Getting a WIN32 development enviroment for developing BETA.</H1>

To use your Windows system for BETA development you need the following
software installed.

<ul>
<li><a href="#ssh">SSH</a>
<li><a href="#cvs">CVS</a>
<li><a href="#perl">Perl</a>
<li><a href="#gcc">gcc</a>
<li><a href="#unzip">unzip</a> (optional)
<li><a href="#gdb">gdb</a> (optional)
<li><a href="#msvc">Visual Studio</a> (for an MS-based system only)
<li><a href="#misc">Misc tools</a> (automatic)
</ul>

<p>You <a href="shells">don't need any special shells or Cygwin tools</a>.

<p>When you have finished installing software, you can get your development
track going with the instructions <a href="devsystem.html">here</a>.

<H2><a name="ssh"></a>SSH</H2>

We recommend openSSH or Putty, which both have commandline
based ssh program (called ssh.exe and plink.exe respectively).
See more on <a href="../sysadm/ssh.html">this Danish-language SSH setup
page</a>.

<H2><a name="cvs"></a>CVS</H2>

<p>We now recommend WinCVS, which has a commandline
based program called 'cvs'.  See more on <a href="cvs.html">this
Danish-language CVS setup page</a>.
<P>
Previously, we have used the version of cvs called <a
href="http://www.mjolner.com/Quality/software/software/Pc/Utils/Other/">cvss.9-10-ssh.exe</a>.
This was installed by renaming it to be called cvs.exe and
placing it somewhere in your path.  It's not Y2k compliant and
we can't find the source, but it does understand the CVS_RSH
variable, which is rare on Windows.


<H2><a name="perl"></a>Perl</H2>

You can find perl in

<a href="http://www.mjolner.com/Quality/software/software/Pc/Misc/Perl/ActivePerl-5.6.0.623-MSWin32-x86-multi-thread.msi">

</a>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

or you can get it directly from
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>.
We normally use version 5.6, but there are no known problems
with later versions.
<P>
There is also a GUI frontend available:

<H2><a name="gcc"></a>GCC</H2>

You need GCC and associated tools.  If you are doing GNU-based
development then you will be using the C compiler, linker
and assembler.  If you are doing MS Visual Studio based
development you still need the GCC assembler (gas) for building
betarun, the runtime system.  (This only applies to developers.  End
users of the MS version of the BETA system don't need GCC
installed).

<p>We use the MingW32 version of gcc, which is a native port
to Windows, not the Cygwin version.  MingW32 is available in two versions,
CRTDLL, and MSVCRT, which use two different C runtime libraries.  We
always use the CRTDLL version.

<p>You can get a self-installing exe file from a random release
CD of the BETA system, or from our own download area at 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a href="ftp://ftp.mjolner.dk/mjolner-system/latest/utils/windows/GNU/gcc-2.95.2-qf-runtime-2000-03-27.exe">ftp://ftp.mjolner.dk/mjolner-system/latest/utils/windows/GNU/gcc-2.95.2-qf-runtime-2000-03-27.exe</a>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If you decide to download directly from the MingW32 project,
be aware that we have tested with version 2.95.2 with the new
runtime system from 2000-03-27.  Newer versions may or may
not work.

<p>The only necessary environment variable you need to set is
PATH, which typically needs to be set to:

<p>PATH=C:\gcc-2.95.2\bin;%PATH%

<p>(replace the '%PATH%' with whatever was in PATH before unless you are setting it in a .bat file).

<p>You can set this environment variable in Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System-&gt;Environment (in NT) or in c:\autoexec.bat (on Windows 98).  Beware of trailing spaces!  

<H2><a name="unzip"></a>Unzip (optional)</H2>

We normally use <a href="http://www.mjolner.com/Quality/software/software/Pc/Recommended/">Powerarchiver</a>.

<H2><a name="gdb"></a>GDB (optional)</H2>

This is the GNU debugger, and it can be useful for debugging, especially
if you have a GNU-based BETA development system.  You can compile programs
with the flag "-s 88" to make executables that can be 
debugged with gdb.

<p>You can find gdb-4.17 at <a
href="http://www.mjolner.com/Quality/software/software/Pc/Utils/GNU/">http://www.mjolner.com/Quality/software/software/Pc/Utils/GNU/</a>
or a somewhat newer version at <a
href="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/mingw32/porters/Mikey/">ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/mingw32/porters/Mikey/</a>.

<H2><a name="msvc"></a>MS Visual Studio (optional)</H2>

If you want to develop the MS version of the BETA system, then you need
to install MS Visual Studio.  You must ensure that the C compiler, cl,
is in your PATH.  The installer does not do that.

<H2><a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous tools</H2>

There are miscellaneous GNU tools already committed into bin_ntiwrappers
and therefore automatically available to BETA developers.  The source
files are in the subdirectory gnusrc in order to comply with the GPL.  You
can delete this directory to save space, but it will return every time you
do 'cvs update -d' (so don't do that).

<p>These utilities are compiled by the
Mingw32 project, therefore they are 'native' Windows versions, and do
not need any special DLLs.  Most of them are from
<a href="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/mingw32/porters/Mikey/">ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/mingw32/porters/Mikey/</a>.

<p>They include GNU make, patch and diff, cut, find and xargs, fmt, head
and tail, md5sum, sum, tr, wc, sort and uniq.  There is also
a minimal shell for use with GNU make, shmsdos, courtesy of
the Mozilla project.

<p>They all understand the --usage option, but no documentation is installed
by default.  Documentation is probably available on a random Linux machine,
through Google or by looking in the source files.


<H2><a name="shells"></a>A word on shells and Cygwin</H2>

<p>We have seen various difficult to understand/reproduce errors caused
by people who install Cygwin in order to have a more comfortable shell.
If you install Cygwin, you must be sure that it is later in your PATH
than the tools described on this page.  The problems include, but are
not limited to Cygwin software that expects newlines at the end of each
line (instead of the Windows cr-lf convention) and executables that 
won't work on non-Cygwin machines.

<p>If you want the command line (DOS box) on Windows to be more comfortable
or Unix-like we can recommend the program 'tweakui', available through
Google and 
<a href="http://www.mjolner.com/Quality/software/software/Pc/Utils/MS/">here</a>
which lets you activate a lot of usability features.

<H2>Now get a development track and boot it</H2>

<p>When you have finished installing software, you can get your development
track going with the instructions <a href="devsystem.html">here</a>.
