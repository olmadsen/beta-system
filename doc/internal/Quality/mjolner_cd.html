<H1>Creating Hybrid CD with the Mjølner System</H1>

<EM>The procedure described below has been replaced with the procedure
described in <A HREF="unixfreeze.html#hybrid">unixfreeze.html</A></EM>
<P>
The following is a description of the steps required to produce a Hybrid
CD (i.e. a CD that can be used on both UNIX, Macintosh and PC), with the
Mjølner System.
<P>
The actual burning of the CD takes place on <STRONG>Ran</STRONG>,
using the <CODE>HyCD</CODE> program, but several things must be done
on other computers - see below.

<H2>Pack systems for each platform</H2>

<H2>Text files</H2>
Text files (with extension <CODE>.txt</CODE>) should be stored with
PC linebreaks (CR-LF). This will be readable on all three platforms.
However, if a text file is only relevant to macintosh or UNIX, it may be 
stored with linebreaks for those platforms.

<H2>Packing Macintosh files</H2>
A number of special arrangements must be done to successfully pack 
macintosh files from the PC. 

<H3>Specify filename-extension-to-file-type/creator mapping</H3>

For each type of file, that will be visible on the CD once opened on a
macintosh, you should secify a mapping between the filename extension
and the macintosh File Creator and Type. On a macintosh, you can fetch
these informations using <CODE>ResEdit</CODE>: Open the file, you want
to get information about from the <CODE>Get File/Folder Info</CODE>
menu item on the <CODE>File</CODE> menu.
<P>
In <CODE>HyCD</CODE>, you can then specify these mappings in ...

<H3>Macintosh files with Resource Fork</H3>

To get a macintosh file with resource fork stored correctly on the CD,
you must do as follows. Most macintosh files have a resource fork
(physically in a separate disk entry, but on the mac never explicitly
visible in the Finder), e.g. all programs, but for instance BinHed'ed
files (ending in <CODE>.hqx</CODE> have <EM>no</EM> resource fork by
default.
<OL>
<LI>Create the files you want stored on the macintosh.<BR> 
If possible, use DOS 8x3 file names. Then the file names will appear
correctly on PC too. If you do not use 8x3 names, the filenames will
appear garbled on PC, but will still appear correctly on Macintosh.
Specificly the toplevel directory name of the macintosh stuff you
want to include on the CD should have a name of at most 8 chars (e.g.
<CODE>macintosh</CODE>), since this will normally be visible on PC/Unix
next to the directories for the other platforms
This 8x3 limitation is not caused by the PC software, but by the
Macintosh interface to PC disks (<CODE>PC Exchange</CODE>) only
supporting DOS file systems, and not Windows NT file systems (should be fixed in MacOS 8.1 - not tested).
<LI>Mount a DOS formatted PC disk (or Syquest) on the Macintosh.
<LI>Copy the macintosh files to this disk from the Finder.
<LI>Mount the disk on PC
<LI>Copy the toplevel <CODE>macintosh</CODE> file to the PC.<BR>
Copy <EM>everything</EM> in the <CODE>macintosh</CODE> directory
to the directory, where you are preparing the CD image. 
There will normally be a directory named <CODE>Resource.frk</CODE> and
a file named <CODE>Finder.dat</CODE> in each macintosh directory, but other 
special files may be present too. Observe also that files/directories which 
does not have 8x3 names will have garbled file names on the PC.
<LI>If you copy a deep structure from the mac, where the macintosh specific 
stuff does not appear at the top of this structure, you only need to copy the 
special files from the macintosh toplevel directory and downwards. Assuming, 
that the generic parts have 8x3 names.
