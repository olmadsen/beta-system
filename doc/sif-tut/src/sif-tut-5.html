<P> Browsing at the group level is provided in the following way:</P>

<LI> If an ORIGIN, BODY, MDBODY or INCLUDE entry is selected in a group viewer, the link to the specified group can be followed by double-clicking on it. The contents of the group viewer is replaced with the specified fragment group (if it exists). Shift-double-click gives a separate source browser.
