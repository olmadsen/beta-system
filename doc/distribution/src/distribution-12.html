<H2> TimeServer</H2>

<P> This example consists of a <INX>timeServer</INX> with a number of clients. At startup a client registers itself with a timeServer. When this is done, the timeServer will call a method in the timeClient once each second. Note that this means that in the usual RPC sense, the timeServer is now a client of its timeClients, since it is the server that executes methods in the clients.</P>
<P> timeServer.bet has no user interface while timeClient.bet is a simple X/motif program displaying the wall-clock time. </P>
<P> To run this example, copy the programs to a directory of your own and compile:</P>
<BETA>
beta timeServer timeClient
</BETA>
<P> Now execute a timeServer on some network host (remember that the ensembleDeamon should be running already), and finally execute some number of timeClients. As command line parameter, the timeClient takes the name of the ensemble on which the timeServer is expected to run. Default is the local ensemble, if no parameters are given.</P>
