<H2> The <INX>distributionDir</INX>virtual</H2>
<P> When using ensemble.createShell to start shell processes, createShell needs to know the location of the remoteStart script and the startAsDeamon executable on the target host. Default location of these scripts is in a subdirectory of the directory containing BETA distribution source files. </P>
<P> In the current Mjolner System, remoteStart is by default placed in the BETALIB/distribution/private/external directory, which is also the default value returned from distributionDir. </P>
<P> However, when shipping applications, as described in section 5.6, it is convenient to be able to put these system executables into another directory chosen by the application developer.</P>
<P> As for defaultAppsDir, distributionDir is changed by either setting the BETALIB environment variable, or by further binding distributionDir and assign a full path to dir within the further binding.</P>
