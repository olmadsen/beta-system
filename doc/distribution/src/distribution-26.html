<H1> System Dependencies</H1>
<P> This section describes the system files and executables needed for distributed BETA programs to work.  Apart from subsection 5.1 that describes how to start the ensembleDeamon, the rest of this section describes non-standard ways of tailoring the distribution library. Therefore, most of this section can be skipped on first read of this manual.</P>
<P> The $ sign is used to denote the actual machinetype. For example, on a Sun SPARC running Solaris 2.x, $ should be read as sun4s.</P>
