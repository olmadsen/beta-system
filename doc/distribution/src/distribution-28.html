<P> executable on the target host. By default these executables are installed with execution rights for everyone.</P>



<P> remoteStart is a simple shell script determining the current machine type before invoking the machine specific startAsDeamon <A NAME=MARKER-2-71></A>executable, which in turn executes the shell executable as a deamon. remoteStart is executed using rsh (remsh on HP UX platforms) on remote network hosts, or executed directly by the distributed BETA process, in case the new shell is started on the local host. If rsh is not found in the standard directory for the platform, the rshPath virtual described in section 5.5 can be used to tell shellEnv about the location of the rsh executable.</P>
