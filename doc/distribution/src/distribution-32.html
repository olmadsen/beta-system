<H2> <INX>Shipping</INX> distributed BETA programs</H2>
<P> As described in previous sections, distributed BETA applications rely on the presence of the ensembleDeamon process. In addition, if using the ensemble.createShell method, the remoteStart script and the machine specific startAsDeamon executable must be present.</P>
<P> When shipping distributed BETA applications, these system scripts and executables must therefore be shipped along. To allow remoteStart and startAsDeamon to be located in a directory chosen by the application developer, shellEnv includes the distributionDir virtual, making it possible to specify an alternative path. distributionDir is described in section 5.3.</P>
