<H2> The <INX>globalErrorHandler</INX>virtual</H2>
<P> The globalErrorHandler is a virtual errorHandler specifying the default handling of network errors. Further bind globalErrorHandler to specify the global errorHandler for shellEnv. If communication exceptions are not caught by another errorHandler they will eventually propagate to globalHandler, which is an instance of globalErrorHandler. If the exception is not handled there, the process is terminated by calling theShell.kill.</P>
<P> Additional attributes of globalErrorHandler are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI><INX>concurrentRequestLimit</INX>: The maximum number of simultaneous incoming requests to this shell that is allowed. Default (-1) corresponds to no limit. If handling a request would result in breaking this limit, the request will be ignored and the client side exception serverOverload raised.
<LI><INX>workerPoolSize</INX>: Determines the size of the pool of workers to handle incoming requests. A worker is a collection of resources needed to handle a request. Because it is cheaper to reuse these resources than to allocate new ones, the workerPool keeps track of unemployed workers ready for reuse. A reasonable value for workerPoolSize is the expected mean number of requests handled simultaneously. If a request is always executed to end without suspending implicitly of explicitly, a single worker is adequate.
</UL>
