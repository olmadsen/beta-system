<H1> Restrictions</H1>
<P> The following restrictions should be kept in mind when writing distributed BETA programs based on version 1.6 of the distribution library. They have all been described in details in previous sections.</P>
<UL>
<LI> Only remoteables can be accessed remotely.
<LI> The public (remotely accessible) part of remoteable patterns must be declared in shellEnvLib:attributes SLOT of shellEnv.
<LI> Parameters to remoteable entry's must be attributes of the entry object and not attributes of e.g. the remoteable that is the static father of the entry.
<LI> Remoteable entries should not be virtual. If they are, the patterns of the real object must be linked with the client and should be declared in the shellEnvLib:attributes SLOT of shellEnv.
<LI> As there is no support for dynamic linking, objects transferred between shells (see section 6.2) must be instances of patterns known to both shells, i.e. the patterns must be linked into both shells. If they are not, an unknownPattern exception will result.
</UL>
