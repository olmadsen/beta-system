<H1> The basic building blocks</H1>
<P> The main patterns of the distribution library are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Remoteable<A NAME=MARKER-2-4></A>: The abstract super pattern of patterns whose instances are remotely accessible.
<LI> Ensemble<A NAME=MARKER-2-5></A>: An instance of the ensemble pattern represents the operating system of some network host. That is, logically there is  exactly one ensemble instance for each network host<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></EM>.
<LI> Shell<A NAME=MARKER-2-6></A>: Each instance of the Shell pattern represents a single physical address space. A Shell thus corresponds to an operating system process.
<LI> NameServer<A NAME=MARKER-2-7></A>: Nameservers provide a way for distributed BETA programs to make their services available to other BETA programs. A server can provide a service by giving an object reference to some name server, i.e. registering the service in the name server. Clients may then contact the name server to lookup services required.
<LI> ErrorHandler<A NAME=MARKER-2-8></A>: The errorHandler provides a scope in which exceptions raised by communication errors may be caught and handled gracefully.
</UL>
<P> Figure 1 shows an example of a distributed system with three ensembles. The arrows symbolize object references. For example, a shell instance knows the ensemble on which it is running by having a reference to the ensemble object.</P>

 However, the distribution library allows several ensembles to coexist. See section 5.4.
