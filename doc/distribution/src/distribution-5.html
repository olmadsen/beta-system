<H2> The basic building blocks</H2>
<P> The main patterns of the distribution library are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> <INX>Remoteable</INX>: The abstract super pattern of patterns whose instances are remotely accessible.
<LI> <INX>Ensemble</INX>: An instance of the ensemble pattern
represents the operating system of some network host. That is,
logically there is  exactly one ensemble instance for each network
host
<FOOTNOTE>However, the distribution library allows several ensembles 
to coexist. See section 5.4</FOOTNOTE>.
<LI> <INX>Shell</INX>: Each instance of the Shell pattern represents a single physical address space. A Shell thus corresponds to an operating system process.
<LI> <INX>NameServer</INX>: Nameservers provide a way for distributed BETA programs to make their services available to other BETA programs. A server can provide a service by giving an object reference to some name server, i.e. registering the service in the name server. Clients may then contact the name server to lookup services required.
<LI> <INX>ErrorHandler</INX>: The errorHandler provides a scope in which exceptions raised by communication errors may be caught and handled gracefully.
</UL>
<P> Figure 1 shows an example of a distributed system with three ensembles. The arrows symbolize object references. For example, a shell instance knows the ensemble on which it is running by having a reference to the ensemble object.</P>
