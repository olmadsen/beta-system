<H2> The NameServer pattern</H2>
<P> All object-oriented systems supporting multiple processes need a
way to handle the exchange of object references. In distributed BETA,
the approach is the provision of an abstract superpattern, the
NameServer. In short, a name server simply provides a mapping between
textual names and object references. The exact semantics of this
mapping depends on the actual subpattern of the abstract NameServer
superpattern
<FOOTNOTE>An abstract superpattern is a pattern supposed to be used only as a superpattern, and not instantiated itself</FOOTNOTE>.</P>

<P> The <INX>put</INX> operation takes a textual name and an object reference as parameters, and saves the association for later retrieval (i.e. registering the object reference). </P>
<P> The get operation in turn retrieves an object reference given its associated name and a pattern reference used for type checking. </P>
<P> Finally, remove deletes an object registration.</P>
<P> Example BETA code exporting a calculator reference to a name server (ns) is shown below. </P>

<BETA>
c: ^calculator;
ns: ^NameServer;
...
(c[],"Simple Calculator")->ns.put;
