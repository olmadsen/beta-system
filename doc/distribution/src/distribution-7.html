<H1> The NameServer pattern</H1>
<P> All object-oriented systems supporting multiple processes need a way to handle the exchange of object references. In distributed BETA, the approach is the provision of an abstract superpattern, the NameServer. In short, a name server simply provides a mapping between textual names and object references. The exact semantics of this mapping depends on the actual subpattern of the abstract NameServer superpattern<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></EM>.</P>
<P> The put<A NAME=MARKER-2-10></A> operation takes a textual name and an object reference as parameters, and saves the association for later retrieval (i.e. registering the object reference). </P>
<P> The get operation in turn retrieves an object reference given its associated name and a pattern reference used for type checking. </P>
<P> Finally, remove deletes an object registration.</P>
<P> Example BETA code exporting a calculator reference to a name server (ns) is shown below. </P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
c: ^calculator;
ns: ^NameServer;
...
(c[],&quot;Simple Calculator&quot;)-&gt;ns.put;
</PRE>

 An abstract superpattern is a pattern supposed to be used only as a superpattern, and not instantiated itself.
