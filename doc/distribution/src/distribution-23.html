<H2> The <INX>defaultScreenName</INX>virtual</H2>

<P> Instances of shellEnv created by ensemble.createShell cannot use the standard inputs and outputs of the process. By default standard output is redirected to /dev/null on UNIX.</P>
<P> To redirect output to a file, specify a filename by further binding defaultScreenName. Alternatively screenName may be set individually for created shells by using the ensemble.createShell.screenName virtual. This allows the creator to override the defaultScreenName of the shell created. </P>
<P> stdout as well as stderr are redirected to the file named in defaultScreenName or in ensemble.createShell.screenName. Since output on stdout and stderr from remotely started shells should normally be restricted to debugging output, stdout and stderr are unbuffered in order to ensure that all output is actually written to the file specified, and in the order the output was written to stdout respectively stderr. If a shell is started from the commandline, defaultScreenname has no effect, since stdout and stderr are then used without modification.</P>

<P> Shells started by createShell have no stdin, and is thus not allowed to read from standard input.</P>
