<H1> The rshPath <A NAME=MARKER-2-75></A>virtual</H1>
<P> Currently, ensemble.createShell depends on rsh in order to start new shells on remote hosts. To support systems with rsh installed in a non-standard directory, the rshPath virtual allows for the specification of the location of the rsh system command. rshPath should be specified to the full path of rsh (remsh on HP-UX). If rshPath is not further specified, the system default is used. Usually there should be no need for changing the rshPath.</P>
