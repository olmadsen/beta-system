<H2> The remoteable pattern</H2>
<P> Remoteable is the superpattern of all objects whose methods may be executed remotely. The attributes of <INX>remoteable</INX> are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>entry: The entry pattern must be used as prefix for methods to be executed remotely, i.e. called from objects in other processes. In the current release, entry subpatterns must be non-virtual.
<LI>ping: Returns true if the object is currently accessible and false otherwise. 
</UL>
<P> If an entry is called in a local object, the overhead is limited to a simple boolean check and an INNER call. Thus, remoteable entries can be used efficiently also in the local case.</P>
<P> Subpatterns of remoteable.entry are not allowed to be virtual<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</A></EM>.</P>
<P> This restriction may seem critical, but the problem is circumvented through an extra indirection. To see how, check the example programs.</P>
