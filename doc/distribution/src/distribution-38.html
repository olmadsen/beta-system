<H1> Distribution and X libraries</H1>
<P> Since shellEnv is based on systemEnv, and systemEnv is capable of cooperating with the X user interface libraries<A NAME=MARKER-2-83></A>, this of course goes for shellEnv too. However, notice that e.g. xshell.bet must be used as origin for programs combining X and distribution (see section 4.1).</P>
<P> One minor catch should be noted when combining X and shellEnv. Consider the skeleton program below combining motifenv with shellEnv.</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/distribution/xshell';
INCLUDE '~beta/Xt/motifenv';
--- program:descriptor ---
shellEnv
(# setWindowEnv:: 
     (# do myWindowEnv[]-&gt;theWindowEnv[] #);
   myWindowEnv: @motifEnv 
     (# ... 
     do &lt;&lt;Initialize myWindowEnv&gt;&gt;
     #);
   shellType:: (# ... #)
   ...
#)
</PRE>
<P> The setWindowEnv virtual and theWindowEnv reference are declared in basicsystemenv. myWindowEnv does not have to be a motifenv instance as long as it is at least an xtenv instance. (one of awenv, motifenv or xtenv).</P>
<P> And now for the catch: The do-part of myWindowEnv is executed by systemEnv as soon as it has finished initialisation. Unfortunately this means that shellEnv has not yet been properly initialized. To avoid problems, the do-part of myWindowEnv should be empty, and initialisation should be done by an explicit init method called when shellEnv has been properly initialised:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/distribution/xshell';
INCLUDE '~beta/Xt/motifenv';
--- program:descriptor ---
shellEnv
(# setWindowEnv:: 
     (# do myWindowEnv[]-&gt;theWindowEnv[] #);
   myWindowEnv: @motifEnv 
     (# ...
        init: 
          (# 
          do &lt;&lt;Initialize myWindowEnv&gt;&gt;
          #);
     do (* Nothing *)
     #);
   shellType:: (# ... #)
do myWindowEnv.init;...
#)
</PRE>
<P> This problem will be solved in future releases of systemEnv.</P>
