<H1> <A NAME=MARKER-9-46></A><A NAME=MARKER-8-47></A>RecList</H1>
 RecList<A NAME=MARKER-2-48></A> is a subpattern of the list pattern, and makes it possible to represent recursive lists. TheCellType is further bound to include the sublist reference, and if the list position represents a sublist, sublist will contain a reference to the sublist. TheCellType further defines the when attribute, which may be used to specify actions to be executed in case the list position contains an element reference, respectively a sublist. Finally, recList defines the following additional operations:<P>

 insertSublistBefore, insertSublistAfter: Takes a list and a list position, and inserts the list as a sublist before (respectively after) the list position<P>
 RecList defines the exception illegalSublist, which is invoked if the elements of an sublist are not instances of a subpattern of the element type of this recList.<P>
