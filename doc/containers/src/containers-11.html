<H2><INX>ArrayContainer</INX></H2>
 ArrayContainer is a subpattern of the container pattern. ArrayContainer is an abstraction of an element repetition, implementing the following additional attributes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>put, get: inserts/returns an element reference at a given position.
<LI>bubble-, shell- and quicksort: sorting operations. 
<LI>capacityInitial, capacityIncrement, capacityExtend: are used for controlling the strategy for extending the ArrayContainer.  capacityInitial is used to specify the initial size of the repetition. capacityIncrement is used to specify the additional index values to be allocated when the capacityExtend is invoked.
</UL>
<H2><INX>SequentialContainer</INX></H2>
 SequentialContainer is a subpattern of the container pattern and is the abstract superpattern for patterns in the container libraries that implements data structures, where the elements are sequentially ordered, and where only the elements in the front or back of this sequence can be manipulated (e.g. stacks and queues). SequentialContainer does not define any additional operations.<P>
