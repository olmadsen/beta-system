 SequentialContainer<A NAME=MARKER-2-30></A> is a subpattern of the container pattern and is the abstract superpattern for patterns in the container libraries that implements data structures, where the elements are sequentially ordered, and where only the elements in the front or back of this sequence can be manipulated (e.g. stacks and queues). SequentialContainer does not define any additional operations.<P>
