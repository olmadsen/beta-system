<H1>Using the <INX>Container Libraries</INX></H1>
 The container libraries consists of a number of fragments: container, collection, sets, classification, arrayContainer, hashTable, seqContainers, list and recList:<P>
<UL>
<LI> container.bet contains the definition of the abstract pattern container. It is the origin fragment for all the other container fragments.
<LI> collection.bet contains the definition of the abstract pattern collection. It is the origin for the sets, classification and hashTable fragments.
<LI> sets.bet contains the definition of the <B>multiSet and set</B> patterns. It is the origin of the classification fragment.
<LI> classification.bet contains the definition of the <B>classificationSet</B> pattern.
<LI> hashTable.bet contains the definition of the <B>hashTable and extensibleHashTable</B> patterns.
<LI> arrayContainer.bet contains the definition of the <B>ArrayContainer</B> pattern.
<LI> list.bet contains the definition of the <B>list</B> pattern.
<LI> recList.bet contains the definition of the <B>recList</B> pattern.
<LI> seqContainers.bet contains the definition of the abstract pattern sequentialContainer along with the <B>stack, queue, prioQueue and deque</B> patterns.
</UL>
 An application may utilize the container libraries by including the appropriate library fragment. E.g. in order for an application to utilize the multiSet pattern, the application must have the following outline:<P>

<BETA>
ORIGIN '~beta/basiclib/betaenv';
INCLUDE '~beta/containers/sets'
--- program: descriptor ---
(# ...
   recordBag: @multiSet(# element:: record #);
   aRecord: @record;
   aPerson: @person; (* person is a subpattern of record *)
   ...
do ...
   recordBag.init;
   ...
   aPerson[] -> recordBag.insert;
   ...
   aRecord[] -> recordBag.insert;
   ...
   recordBag.scan(# where:: (# current.key&lt;3000 -> value #)
                 do current.print
                 #);
   (* prints all records in recordBag that has a key less that 
    * 3000. It is assumed that record implements a virtual print 
    * operation
    *)
   ...
#)
</BETA>
 In order to utilize the other fragments, just replace<P>
<BETA>
INCLUDE '~beta/containers/sets'
</BETA>
 with e.g.<P>
<BETA>
INCLUDE '~beta/containers/hashTable'
</BETA>
 and in order to use more than one container fragment, just insert several INCLUDEs:<P>

<BETA>
INCLUDE '~beta/containers/sets';
INCLUDE '~beta/containers/hashTable'
</BETA>
 Note that since the container fragments has ORIGIN in betaenv, the above is equivalent to:<P>
<BETA>
ORIGIN '~beta/containers/sets'
--- program: descriptor ---
(# ...
   recordBag: @multiSet(# element:: record #);
   ...
do ...
   ...
#)
</BETA>
