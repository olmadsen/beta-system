<H1> Selection </H1>
<P> Selection is important because most operations in Mjolner are performed in relation to the current selection, which will always be marked in reverse video. There are different ways of selecting parts of a fragment. </P>
<P> When you position the cursor somewhere in the Code editor and click the Selection Button the nearest surrounding structure will be selected and marked as the current selection. </P>
<P> Some examples of how to select: </P>

<DL>
<DT><B>To select a name:</B><DD>
<DT><DD>just place the cursor in the name and click the Selection Button.
<DT><B>To select a complete structure containing keywords :</B><DD>
<DT><DD>place the cursor at one of the keywords and click the Selection Button:
</DL>
<P> </P>
<CENTER><GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/structure-select-before.gif></CENTER>
<P> </P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Then the resulting current selection becomes:
</DL>
<P> </P>
<CENTER><GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/structure-select-after.gif></CENTER>
<P> </P>
<DL>
<DT><B>To select all elements in a list:</B><DD>
<DT><DD>place the cursor at one of the list separators e.g. a ';', and click the Selection Button.
<DT><B>To select a sublist:</B><DD>
If a sublist of elements is going to be the current selection, dragging selection is a convenient technique. Dragging selection means clicking with the Selection Button at the starting point of the sublist and keeping the button down while moving the mouse to the ending point of the sublist.

<P> </P>
<CENTER><GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/sublist-select-before.gif></CENTER>
<P> </P>

At this point the button is released and the current selection will be set to the selected sublist:

<P> </P>
<CENTER><GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/sublist-select-after.gif></CENTER>
<P> </P>

</DL>
<P> In general the smallest complete enclosing structure will be selected.</P>
