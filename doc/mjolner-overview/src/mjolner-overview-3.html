<H1> Overview</H1>

The Mj&oslash;lner Tool is an integrated development tool with the following components: a source browser and editor,  a source level debugger, an interface builder and a CASE tool. The Mj&oslash;lner Tool is also integrated with the BETA compiler.


<H2>Source Browser (Ymer) and Editor (Sif)</H2> 
Using abstract presentation and semantic browsing Sif and Ymer provides good overview of libraries and frameworks including your own design and code. Sif is a structure editor. It always operates on complete structures. Sif prevents syntax errors and has powerful operations for modifying even larges pieces of code. The need for scrolling is reduced, making it easy to select large structures not fitting in a  window.

<H2>Source Level Debugger (Valhalla) </H2>
Valhalla supports breakpoints, single stepping, tracing, object indpection, stack inspection, code inspection, source browsing etc. The accompanying object browser can be used to inspect objects in a persistent store.

<H2>Interface builder (Frigg) </H2>
Frigg supports direct construction of graphical user interfaces with automatic incremental code generation and incremental reverse engineering. The developer can alternate between working on the user interface and coding the underlying functionality.

<H2>CASE tool (Freja)</H2>
Freja supports the UML-based syntax for BETA. Freja has incremental code generation and incremental reverse engineering. This is achieved without destroying the overview of the code with internal technical comments. Changes in the design are immediately reflected in the code and vice versa. Freja makes it easy to alternate between design and implementation.
