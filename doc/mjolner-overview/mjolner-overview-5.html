<A NAME=HEADING5-0></A>
<H1> <A NAME="LINK-mjolner-overview-_Toc366231458"><A NAME=MARKER-9-1></A>Debugger</A></H1>
<P> Valhalla<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></EM> is the source level debugger in the Mj&oslash;lner BETA System.  Valhalla offers an object oriented environment for the debugging of BETA programs.  Using Valhalla, you are able to control the execution of any BETA program; inspect the state of runtime objects; and trace the execution of the BETA code implementing the functionality of the application. The aim of Valhalla is to help the programmer to locate errors in BETA programs by tracing their execution at the BETA source level.</P>
<P> The user interface is divided in two integrated parts: the source browser (Ymer), and the Valhalla Universe.  The source browser enables browsing in the source code of the application being debugged (as well as other source files), and the Valhalla Universe enables the display of runtime objects, execution stacks and source code of the actual execution during the execution of the application.</P>
<P> &lt;&lt;fig&gt;&gt;</P>
<P> The program execution<A NAME=MARKER-2-3></A> may be controlled e.g. by setting breakpoints and single stepping at the BETA source level. Runtime errors are caught by Valhalla that will display the offending object and code. From there, program state can be browsed to locate the cause of error. The debugged program executes in a process of its own, being watched by Valhalla, but otherwise unaffected.</P>
<P> Using the Mj&oslash;lner BETA Debugger you may:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Control and trace the execution of a BETA program by setting breakpoints and stepping at the level of single BETA source lines, stepping over procedure-calls and even single step at the level of machine code instructions.
<LI>Simultaneously examine the state of any number of objects.
<LI>Examine the execution stack and view code and objects on the stack.
<LI>Examine the program heaps and view objects on the heaps.
<LI>Simultaneously view any number of windows containing source code.
</UL>
<P> The source browser used by Valhalla is Ymer, and it is therefore identical to the source browser used by the other programming tools in the Mj&oslash;lner BETA System (such as Sif <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia90-11">[MIA 90-11]</A>, Freja <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia93-31">[MIA 93-31]</A> and Frigg <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia96-33">[MIA 96-33]</A>), making browsing in the source code of the application of the program being debugged, identical to the browsing facilities during editing, etc.  The source browser has been augmented with pull-down and pop-up menus for setting breakpoints and trace points, and for controlling the execution of the application.</P>

<A NAME=HEADING5-13></A>
<H2> Trace points<A NAME=MARKER-2-4></A></H2>
<P> In order to make it easy to trace the execution of the application, Valhalla offers trace points.  A trace point is a point in the source code, with an associated text string.  Each time the execution passes a trace point, the text string is printed on the standard output.  The text string is specified as part of the specification of the trace point.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-15></A>
<H2> Break points<A NAME=MARKER-2-5></A></H2>
<P> In order to inspect the state of objects during the execution of the application, Valhalla offers break points.  A break point is a point in the source code.  Each time the execution passes a break point, control is passed back to Valhalla, enabling you to inspect the state of the execution, the state of runtime objects, etc.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-17></A>
<H2> Execution Control<A NAME=MARKER-2-6></A></H2>
<P> Using Valhalla, you can control the execution of any BETA application.  You can start and stop the execution, set break points and trace points, single step at the level of machine code instructions, at the level of BETA imperatives, step over procedure calls, etc.</P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-19></A>
<H2> Runtime Inspection<A NAME=MARKER-2-7></A></H2>
<P> Valhalla offers extensive support for inspection of the runtime structure of the running application.  You can examine the state of objects and runtime stacks.  Using the easy-to-use graphical interface, you can navigate through the entire object structure, and locate any object in the application, inspecting its state.</P>

<P> This manual consists of two parts: A tutorial and a reference manual. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basics of BETA program executions and the fragment system, see for example <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia90-2">[MIA 90-2]</A> for a description of the fragment system</P>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE-2>[2] </A>
  Valhalla is the name of the Hall of the Nordic God Odin.  Valhalla is the place whereto all the dead warriors are brought when they have fallen as heroes on the battlefield.  Odin is the highest ranking God in Asgaard.
