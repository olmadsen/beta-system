<H2><INX>An Example Application</INX></H2>
This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Frigg to make a small address
book application. The application is structured into three parts:
<p>addressbook The classes that defines the data objects in the application.
<p>addressbookgui The classes that defines the graphical user interface.
<p>addressbookappl The controlling application that ties the data model
to the graphical user interface.
<p>The <INX>data model</INX> is created in <INX>Freja</INX>
(Mj&oslash;lner BETA CASE tool). The following <INX>diagram</INX>
describes the data model for the addressbook application:

<p>The Freja manual can be consulted to get an explanation of the graphical
notation used in the diagram.
<p>Here is a short description of the classes in the diagram:
<p>addressbook Has a list of persons.
<p>person Has a number of simple attributes: name, CPR etc., a reference
to the current address, and a list of occupations.
<p>address Simple attributes: Street, city etc.
<p>occupation Can be teacher, student and employee. This part of the model
is left out of the application for simplicity.
<p>The addressbook model does not have visibility to the addressbookgui
(i.e. it does not INCLUDE the addressbookgui fragmentgroup). This ensures
that the addressbook data objects can be made <INX>persistent objects</INX>.
<p>The addressbookgui does not know about the addressbook <INX>data model</INX>.
This allows the addressbook user interface to be reused in other applications.
<p>The addressbookappl includes both the data model and the user interface,
and ties the two together.
<p>The following sections will explain how to create the user interface
and the application.
