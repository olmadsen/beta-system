<H3>Creating the adressbookgui fragmentgroup</H3>

<CENTER><GIF SRC="images/addresgui.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
Here the addressbookGUI file is already created. This was done
automatically by the interface builder. The file has
ORIGIN in guienv and contains a GUIenvLib fragmentform. The GUIenvLib
fragmentform can contain specializations of the window class in Lidskjalv
(The Mj&oslash;lner BETA user interface framework).

<H3>Creating the addressbook window</H3>
The addressbook window is created as a specialization of window via the
<INX>UML</INX> command in the toolbar:
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/GUImenu.gif"></center>

<p>In the create dialog the name of the window are entered.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/createwin.gif"></center>

<p>Pressing Create in the dialog the graphical editor window appears:
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/GraphicalObj.gif" height=446 width=548></center>

<p>The empty area with a border is the <INX>content area</INX>
of the window. This area has been resized to the desired size by dragging
the border.
<p>The palette at the top of the window contains the standard Lidskjalv
window items, such as push-button and text field.

<H3><INX>Adding items</INX></H3>
The first items that will be added to the window, is simple text label
and text fields. This is the fourth and the fifth item on the simple item
palette. The items are added by <INX>dragging the items</INX>
from the palette to the content area of the window.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/ItemInserted.gif" height=461 width=462></center>

<p>Here the items are added, and the text in the labels are changed to
'Name:', 'Phone:' and 'CPR:'. These changes are made via the 'Object Inspector'
that are invoked by selecting an item and then choosing the <b>Object Inspector</b>
in the <b>Edit</b> menu:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The items are arranged in the window by using the alignment commands
in the 'Align' menu.
<br><a NAME="HEADING5-22"></a>
<H3><INX>Changing the Name</INX></H3>
The items are given default names in the source code that looks like 'editText1'
and 'staticText2', but since these items needs to be referred to in the
application (in order to tie the user interface to the data model) it is
a good idea to change the names. This is done by choosing the '<INX>Edit Name</INX>'
command in the 'Edit' menu:
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/Inspector.gif" height=355 width=347></center>

<p>Here the name of one of the text fields are changed to 'nameField',
which will be easier to remember later.
<br><a NAME="HEADING5-26"></a>
<H3><INX>Compound items</INX></H3>
The address part of the addressbook window are going to be a canvas, which
is a compound item. This is the first item from the right on the palette.
A <INX>canvas</INX> contains other items in its local coordinate
system. Initially the canvas is empty, and then items can be added to the
canvas. These objects move when the canvas are moved.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/Canvas.gif" height=460 width=548></center>

<p>Here the address canvas has been added. The object info <INX>dialog</INX>
has been used to give the canvas an 'etched in' border. The 'Address:'
label are not part of the canvas, but are added to the window.
<p>The address fields 'street' and 'city' can now be added to the canvas
by dragging from the palette to the canvas.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/Canvas2.gif" height=463 width=496></center>

<p>Now the address fields are added. At the bottom of the window three
push-buttons are added. They perform the main functions in the addressbook
window. The other functions can be put in the menubar.
<p>NOTE: The menubar can not be specified in the graphical editor. It will
have to be coded in Sif, see the Lidskjalv manual for information about
doing this.
<p>Furthermore a separator is placed between the buttons and the 'address'
canvas.
<p>Now the user interface is complete. In the next section one way to tie
the user interface and the data model together in an application, will
be explained.
