Linklint is Shareware
</font><blockquote>
Linklint started out as freeware.  I was looking for a fast, high
quality, low cost link checker that would work on Windows and Unix.  I
couldn't find one so I decided to write my own.  As more people
used Linklint and gave me feedback, maintenance and improvement of
the program turned into a full time occupation.  

<p>

I am trying to provide the internet community with a high quality
tool for checking web sites.  I can continue with this effort only if
people who use the program help support the cost of its development.

<p>


Try Linklint for free.  If you want to use it regularly please send
the appropriate fee to:
