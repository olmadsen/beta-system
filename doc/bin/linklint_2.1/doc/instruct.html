This page contains detailed instructions for configuring Linklint to
check a large web site in a worst case scenerio.  Some of the
sections here may not be applicable to your site.  These instructions
are intended only as suggestions to help you quickly get started
checking links.

General Guidelines
</a>
</font><blockquote>

<ul>
<li> Read all the documentation.

<li>Run Linklint on the machine that is serving your site even if you
are checking the site "remotely" with the <i>-http</i> flag.

This has two benefits: Linklint will run faster, and it will be able
to follow links in server-side image maps.

<li>Use the <i>-doc</i> option to create full documentation of
Linklint's results.

<li>Always run Linklint from the same directory.  Keep all of your command
files and <i>-doc</i> directories in this directory.

<li>If at all possible, create your <i>-doc</i> directories in a
location where you can view the results in a browser. This will let
you take advantage of the <i>Linklint.html</i> file which contains 
links to all the output files.

<li>Use the <i>-http</i> flag to check your pages through your http
server.  This will automatically take care of pages generated by CGI
and any server redirections that may occur.

</ul>

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="command">
Create a Command File
</a>
</font><blockquote>

Before checking your site, take the time to put some information about
your site in a command file.  This will avoid a lot of retyping (and
possible typos) later on.  It often makes sense to name the command
file after your host name.  The command file should contain the following:
<font color="#006600"><pre>
# general command file for hostname
-host www.hostname.com
-root /absolute/path/to/your/htmlrootdirectory
-doc linkdoc
-http</pre></font>

Resist the temptation to include any <i>linksets</i> in this command
file.  The reason will become clear when you start <b><a href="#errors">tracking down broken links</a></b>.

<p>


You can check your home page with <tt><b>linklint @hostname</b></tt>.
You can check your entire site with <tt><b>linklint @hostname /@</b></tt>.


</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="sections">
Split the Site into Sections 
<font size=4>(optional)</font>
</a>
</font><blockquote>

If you have a very large site (thousands of pages), it might make
sense to split the site up into several sections and check each
section separately.  One way to do this is to check all the files
in the root directory and then check files in each subdirectory.

<p>

Create a command file named <i>root</i> for checking the root directory:
<font color="#006600"><pre>
# root directory command file
@hostname
-doc rootdoc
/#</pre></font>


For each subdirectory (or group of subdirectories) create a command file
name <i>subdir</i>:
<font color="#006600"><pre>
# command file for subdir
@hostname
-doc subdirdoc
/subdir/@</pre></font>

Now you can check just your root directory with <tt><b>linklint
@root</b></tt> and each subdirectory with <tt><b>linklint @subdir</b></tt>
and the results will be kept in separate output directories.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="check1">
Check your Site
</a>
</font><blockquote>

You are now ready to start checking your site.  Run Linklint with the
appropriate command file.  Examples:

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td><font color="#cc0000"><tt><b>
linklint @hostname /@

</b></tt></font></td><td>check the entire site using command file <i>hostname.</i>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><font color="#cc0000"><tt><b>
linklint @root 

</b></tt></font></td><td>check the root directory using command file <i>root.</i>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><font color="#cc0000"><tt><b>
linklint @subdir

</b></tt></font></td><td>check subdir and below using command file <i>subdir.</i>
</td></tr>

</table>


Most likely there will be some warnings and errors.  There might even
be some hints in the summary.  Review the results that were created
in the <i>-doc</i> directory.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="password">
Add Passwords
</a>
</font><blockquote>

If you get warning messages that say <i>need password for
"realm"</i>, you will have to provide Linklint with a username and
password for each password protected realm.  Add these lines to your
<i>hostname</i> file:

<font color="#006600"><pre>
-password "realm1" username1:password1
-password "realm2" username2:password2</pre></font>

The realms are double quoted in the warning messages.  You will have
to use double quotes in the command file if the realm contains any
space characters.  You can also use the realm "DEFAULT" to
provide a default username and password. The default will be tried
only if a password for the specific realm was not given.  Once you
have made these changes to your command file, check the site again to
make sure that you entered all the information correctly.  You will
get warning messages for invalid username/password combinations.

<p>

<font color="#cc0000"><b>Note:</b></font> The HTTP protocol uses a named <i>realm</i> to
identify a set of pages that share a common set of username/password
combinations.  This system was created so that visitors only need to
be prompted for their username and password once (per session) in
order to browse any number of pages in a given realm.  Realms are
often used to protect all the files under a particular subdirectory,
but they can be used in other configurations.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="imagemap">
Add Server-Side Image Maps
</a>
</font><blockquote>

If your site makes use of server-side images maps, you may have to
add a <i>-map</i> option to your command file so Linklint knows how to
find your <b>.map</b> files.  See <b><a href="specs.html#imagemap">
Server-Side Image Maps</a></b> for a detailed explanation.  You may have
to add one of the following lines to your <i>hostname</i> file:

<font color="#006600"><pre>
-map /cgi-bin/imagemap
-map /cgi-bin/imagemap.exe
-map /cgi-bin/htimage</pre></font>

You will also need to have the <i>-root</i> directory specified so Linklint
knows where to look for map  files locally on your machine.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="errors">
Tracking Down Errors
</a>
</font><blockquote>

Sometimes the error messages generated by Linklint do not provide
sufficient information for figuring out why an error was reported.
In these cases it can be useful to look at the html tags that caused
the errors.  One way to see these tags is to use the <i>-db3</i> flag.
This flag causes all html tags that contain links to be printed out
followed by the fully expanded links.

<p>

Here is one strategy for tracking down errors:
<ol>

<li>Look in the <i>errorF.txt</i> or <i>errorX.txt</i> file to find
the file that caused the error.  

<li>Run <font color="#cc0000"><tt><b>
linklint @hostname /errorfile.html -db3 -doc
dbdoc
</b></tt></font><br>

This will cause all the tags containing links in <i>/errorfile.html</i>
to be printed out in <i>dbdoc/log.txt.</i>

<li>Examine the <i>dbdoc/log.txt</i> file to see the html tags
found by Linklint and the links that were extracted from these tags.

</ol>

If you use this technique frequently, you can avoid repeated typing
by making a <i>debug</i> command file:
<font color="#006600"><pre>
# debug command file
@hostname
-db3
-doc dbdoc
</pre></font>

You can use this file to debug an html page with the command:<br>
<tt><b>linklint @debug /errorfile.html</b></tt>.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="redirect">
Server Redirection
</a>
</font><blockquote>

One of the worst causes of confusion in debugging broken links is
<i>server redirection.</i> Some http servers are programmed to
deliver a different page than the one a visitor asks to see.  

<p>

The most benign form of redirection is when the server program sends
back a <i>moved</i> status code (301 or 302), telling the browser
that the page requested has moved, along with a new url. Linklint
follows these links and reports all moved urls in the file
<i>mapped.txt.</i>

<p>

Sometimes a server is programmed to serve up the contents of a page
that is different from the page requested without giving any hints
to the browser (or to Linklint) that a switch has been made. Take a
simple example where <i>fileA.html</i> is mapped to
<i>fileB.html.</i> 

Linklint will tell you <i>fileA.html</i> is missing whenever
<i>fileB.html</i> is missing even if <i>fileA.html</i> exists!

<p>

Since the server is not providing any clues that this switch
has been made, there is nothing Linklint can do to alleviate the
situation.  I can only suggest that you minimize your use of this
type of server redirection and familiarize yourself with which links
on your site have been mapped this way.
