This page explains in more detail how Linklint performs site checks
and also provides a detailed description of every output file created
by Linklint.

<a name="linkset">
Creating Seeds for a Site Check
</a>
</font><blockquote>

A linkset (entered on the command line) specifies a set of links to
check.  For each linkset a <i>seed</i> is created for starting
Linklint's search of your site.  If the linkset contains no wildcard
characters (<tt><b>@</b></tt> and <tt><b>#</b></tt>), it must be a single link and the complete
linkset becomes a seed file.  If the linkset contains wildcard
characters, the seed is the longest string of non-wildcard characters
starting with the leading "/" and ending with the last "/" before a
wildcard. For example, if you specify <tt><b>/@</b></tt> to check your
entire site, Linklint will start with one seed file "/" which is the
<b><a href="#default">default file</a></b> for your root directory (sometimes
called your <i>home page</i>).



</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="recursion">
Site Check Recursion
</a>
</font><blockquote>

Linklint tries to find all of the pages and files in a site using
recursion.  Each seed is checked and if it is an html file it is
parsed creating a new list of files to check.  These files are
checked creating new lists of files to check and so on.  This process
continues until one of the mechanisms to stop recursion kicks in.

<p>

The primary method used to stop recursion is to only check local
links. A link is considered local if either: it resolves to a file
reference without a scheme or host (<i>i.e.</i> <tt>/something</tt>),
or it resolves to <tt>http://hostname/. . .</tt> and <i>-host
hostname</i> was specified.

<p>

The second method for halting recursion is the use of specific
linksets.  Only html pages that match one or more of the linksets
you specify will be checked for more links.  Html pages which don't
match any of the linksets will be <i>skipped,</i> which means they are
checked to see if they exist but none of the links inside the file
are added to the list of files to check.  You can also specifically
<i>-skip</i> sets of html files or <i>-limit</i> the total number of
html files checked.


</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="parse">
Parsing Html Files
</a>
</font><blockquote>

These are the rules Linklint uses to extract links from html files.

<p>

Any tags inclosed inside of comments tags:

<tt><b>&lt;!-- . . . --&gt;</b></tt><br>

or script tags:

 <tt><b>&lt;script&gt; . . . &lt;/script&gt;</b></tt>

are ignored.

<p> 

The <tt><b>&lt;base href=<font color="#009900">URL</font>&gt;</b></tt> tag will cause Linklint to set
the base scheme, host, path, and file to the appropriate parts of
<tt><font color="#009900">URL</font></tt> for the remainder of the file.  I've tried to emulate
the behavior of the Netscape Navigator 3.0 browser.  In general
missing elements from the front part of a url are filled in from the
base specification.


<p>

Links are extracted from the following tags:

<pre>
&lt;a       href=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font> name=<font color="#009900">NAME</font>&gt;
&lt;applet  codebase=<font color="#009900">BASE</font> code=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;area    href=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;bgsound src=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;body    background=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;embed   src=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;form    action=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;frame   src=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;img     src=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font> lowsrc=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font> dynsrc=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font> usemap=<font color="#009900">NAME</font>&gt;
&lt;input   src=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
&lt;map     name=<font color="#009900">NAME</font>&gt;
&lt;meta    http-equiv=refresh content="... href=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>"&gt;
&lt;script  src=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;
</pre>


Tag and attribute names are case insensitive.  A <tt><font color="#cc0000">LINK</font></tt> can
be bare or enclosed in single or double quotes.  The characters
<tt><b>&lt;</b></tt> and <tt><b>&gt;</b></tt> are allowed inside of a tag only if
they are enclosed in single or double quotes.  Arbitrary whitespace
is allowed around the <tt><b>=</b></tt> sign and between a tag's name and
its attributes.

<p>

Tags and/or attributes that do not match any of the above criteria
are ignored.

<p>

All the links found on an html page are checked.  Non-html links are
checked only for existence.  If a link is to an html file, it will
also get parsed subject to the rules of <b><a href="#recursion">recursion</a></b>.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
Resolving Links
</font><blockquote>

In order to be able to follow links properly and to ensure that
links get checked only once, all links are made absolute before
they are checked.   I have tried to use the same rules as a browser
for making links absolute.  You can use the <i>-db3</i> flag to
see how links get resolved.  This flag causes every tag from
an html file that contains a link to get printed out in the log
file followed by the fully expanded link.

<p>

If a <i>-host</i> is specified, links starting with
"<tt>http://host</tt>" have this text removed, creating a local link.
Thus all local links will start with "/" followed by a full path from
the server root to the file to be checked.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="default">
Default Index Files
</a>
</font><blockquote>

Http servers treat a link to a directory followed by a "/" as a
default file.  The server will look for a (server specific) default
file in the directory and serve that up if it exists.  Otherwise the
server will generate a listing of all of the files and subdirectories
in the directory.

<p>

Linklint emulates this behavior in local site checks by searching for
its own list of default files: <i>home.html, index.html, index.shtml,
index.htm, index.cgi, wwwhome.html, </i>and <i>welcome.html</i>.  If
none of these are found, all the files and subdirectories in the
directory are checked.  You can change the set of default files
Linklint looks for with the <i>-index filename</i> option which will
replace the built-in set with the file(s) you specify.  On the
command line each default file must be preceded with the
<i>-index</i> flag.  If all of the default files are in lowercase,
the search is case insensitive.  If any of the files has an uppercase
letter, the search is case sensitive.

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
What Linklint Won't Check
</font><blockquote>


Linklint will not be able to track down links that require
specific visitor form input.  For example, a search engine site uses
form input from visitors to generate new html pages.  These pages would
not be checked by Linklint.  Likewise, if you have written your own
CGI program that uses the <i>IsMap</i> attribute to create new links
depending on where a visitor clicks on an image, Linklint will not be
able to find these links.


</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="imagemap">
Server-side Image Maps
</a>
</font><blockquote>

Linklint can check all links that are used in both client-side and
server-side image maps.  Client-side image maps are handled
automatically since Linklint parses the <tt>&lt;area href=LINK&gt;</tt>
tag in html files.

<p>

Server-side image maps are a little bit tricky.  Some servers have
the imagemap CGI software built-in so links ending in <i>.map</i> are
treated as map files and automatically sent to the image map program for
processing.  Linklint mimics this behavior.  Any link ending in
<i>.map</i> is parsed as if it were a map file.  In addition, all
<i>.map</i> links are checked locally even if the <i>-http</i> flag
is used since map files are generally not accessible directly via http.

<p>
Some servers require server-side image map links to contains
the path of the CGI image map program followed by the path to the
map file as in:

<p>
<tt>&lt;a href=/cgi-bin/imagemap/dir/info.map&gt;</tt>.
<p>

Here <i>/cgi-bin/imagemap</i> is the location of the image map CGI
program and <i>/dir/info.map</i> is the location of the map file.
Linklint can resolve these links and read the map file (locally only,
even if <i>-http</i> is used). However, you must provide the path
from your server root directory to your image map program using the
<i>-map</i> option.  Three common image map specifications are:
<ul><tt><b> <li>-map /cgi-bin/imagemap <li>-map /cgi-bin/imagemap.exe
<li>-map cgi-bin/htimage </b></tt></ul>

For example, if you set "<tt>-map /cgi-bin/imagemap</tt>", the link
<i>/cgi-bin/imagemap/dir/info.map</i> will be transformed to
<i>/dir/info.map</i> which will be read in locally and parsed as a
map file.  You need to be sure to set <i>-root</i> properly for
Linklint to be able to find the map file.


</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="output">
Output Files
</a>
</font><blockquote>

If a <i>-doc</i> directory is specified, all output files are
written in that directory.  The directory will be created if it does
not already exist. There are two sets of files that are created, one
is for <b><a href="#siteoutput"> site checks</a></b> and the other is for <b><a href="#urloutput">remote url checks</a></b>.

<p>

Even though new files are written only as needed, <i>all</i>
previously written files from each set are erased before new files
from the set are written.  Each set is independent of the other.  The
site-check files will be erased only if you do another site check.
The url-check files will be erased only if you check remote urls again.

<p>

<font color=red>New!</font> Many of the output files now come in html
and text versions.  The html versions look like the text versions but
contain hyperlinks to the resources they refer to.  Files that come
in both versions are listed below without an extension.  If you run
Linklint on its own output files, you will often find broken links.
This is one of life's little ironies.  If you find that Linklint is
creating some totally bogus links, please email me at <a href=mailto:bowlin@sirius.com>
bowlin@sirius.com</a> and let me know.

<p>

<p>

Some of the output files are part of a <i>family.</i> Members of the
family are related using the simple mnemonic of a trail <i>X</i>
meaning cross referenced and a trailing <i>F</i> meaning forward
referenced.  For example: <i>error</i> lists all missing files,
<i>errorX</i> lists the missing files and all html files that
reference them, and <i>errorF</i> lists all html files that
contain links to missing files along with the names of the missing
files. 

</blockquote><p><hr><p><font size=5>
<a name="siteoutput">
Site-Check Output Files
</a>
</font><blockquote>

During local site checking, local links ending in "/" are kept as-is
to maintain consistency with remote site results. However, if a <b><a href="#default">default index file</a></b> was found, it is listed below
the link in square brackets.  If a directory listing is used because
no default file was found, this information is listed in the brackets.

<p>

Any link that Linklint <i>knows</i> has been redirected (either by
the http server or with the <i>-map</i> option), gets an extra line in
the output files showing the orignal link it was mapped from in
parentheses.  See the <b><a href="instruct.html#redirect">Server Redirection</a></b> section for more details.

<p><font size=4>
Site-Check Summary Files
</font><p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>linklint</b></font><br>

an index to all site-check files created.  This list differs from the
summary list in two ways. First, it contains entries for every file
written including cross referenced lists and forward referenced lists
that are missing in the summary. Second, it lacks the detailed
divisions by file type and external link schema that exist in the
summary.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>summary.txt</b></font><br>

summary of site-check results, similar to what gets printed to the
screen.  Every non-empty data family (listed below) will cause a line
to be printed in the summary.  In addition, external links are listed
by the following schema:<b> http, https, ftp, javascript, mailto,
gopher, file, news, view-source, about, unknown</b>. Found and
missing files are listed by file type:

<p>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align=right><b>

</b></td><td>
starting with "/cgi-bin" or containing "?" or .cgi or .pl
</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>

</td></tr><tr><td align=right><b>
other </b></td><td>
all other files
</td></tr></table>

<p>

These distinctions sort files (mostly) by extension, they are not
true indications of the tag the link was found inside, nor of the
MIME format returned by your server.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>log.txt</b></font><br>

log of site-check progress, similar to what gets printed to the screen but
also includes extra output created when <i>-db</i> flags are used.  

<p><font size=4>
Site-Check Data Files
</font><p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>action, actionX</b></font><br>

a list of all ignored actions.  Any link found inside a <tt>&lt;form
action=<font color="#cc0000">LINK</font>&gt;</tt> tag is listed here, but it is not checked
since normally extra input from the form is required.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>anchor, anchorX</b></font><br>

a list of all named anchors found. The <i>anchorX</i> file
lists all files that use each named anchor.  If a named anchor is not
referenced by any of the files checked by Linklint, it will have
no cross references.  Named maps are also included in this list.


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>case, caseX, caseF</b></font><br>

If <i>-case</i> was used during a local site check on a Windows machine,
all files that have references that do not match the (upper/lower)
case of the file are listed here.  This is handy if you are developing
a site on a Windows machine that you are planning to port to a Unix
server.


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>dir.txt</b></font><br>

a list of all the directories that contain files used by the site.
Only created during local site checking.


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>error, errorX, errorF</b></font><br>

a list of all missing files.  A file is listed as missing if:
<ol>
<li> it is referenced by a file checked by Linklint, and
<li> it is a local file, and
<li> it does not match any <i>-ignore</i> expression, and
<li> Linklint could not find the file locally, or
an error occured when Linklint tried to get the file via http.

</ol>

See the <b><a href="#parse">Parsing Html</a></b> section for details.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>errorA, errorAX</b></font><br>

a list of missing named anchors.  A named anchor is missing if:
<ol>
<li> it is referenced by a file checked by Linklint, and
<li> it is located inside of a local file, and
<li> the file it is in is not <i>-ignored</i> or <i>-skipped</i>, and
<li> Linklint could not find the file, or the file was found but the
named anchor does not exist.
</ol>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>errorM, errorMX</b></font><br>

a list of missing named client-side image maps.  The rules for inclusion
in this list are the same as those for missing named anchors.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>file, fileX, fileF</b></font><br>

a list all files found on the site. <i>file</i> is a
list of all files found sorted by file type; <i>fileX</i> is a
cross referenced version, showing a sublist of all the html files
that reference each file in the list; <i>fileF</i> lists each
html file and a sublist of all of the links it references.  These
lists are meant to show file dependencies so multiple links to the
same file result in a single listing.  Likewise, a named anchor
causes the file containing the anchor to be listed, but the actual
named anchors are listed separately.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>httpfail</b></font><br>

a list of all the http errors that occured while trying to remote check
a site.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>httpok</b></font><br>

a list of all the files that were obtained without error while remote
checking a site. 


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>ignore, ignoreX</b></font><br>

a list of all ignored files.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>imgmap, imgmapX</b></font><br>

a list of named image maps for client-side image maps, taken from
tags <tt><b>&lt;img usemap=<font color="#009900">NAME</font>&gt;</b></tt> and <tt><b>&lt;map
name=<font color="#009900">NAME</font>&gt;</b></tt>. 


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>mapped</b></font><br>

a list of all the redirected files that were found while checking a
site either locally or remotely.

<p>

Some servers automatically change the name of a link.  For example a
link to <i>http://host/subdir</i> will get automatically mapped to
<i>http://host/subdir</i> if <i>subdir</i> is a directory.  Many
other mappings are possible.  Linklint will follow these mappings and
treat the resulting file as the actual link (just like a browser
would).

<p>

This is a potential cause for confusion. If your <i>index.html</i>
file has a link to <i>A.html</i> and this gets mapped to
<i>B.html,</i> Linklint will tell you that <i>index.html</i> has a
link to <i>A.html</i> and that it has a link to <i>B.html,</i> but
only <i>B.txt</i> will be listed as a found file.  

<p>

See the <b><a href="instruct.html#redirect">Server Redirection</a></b> section for more details.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>orphan</b></font><br>

If the <i>-orphan</i> flag was used during a local site check, all of
the unused files and subdirectories in each directory that contain
files used by the site, are listed here sorted by directory.  If an
orphan html file contains a meta refresh tag redirecting the visitor
to a different file, this new file is listed under its parent
preceded by " =&gt;".  This method of redirection is often used to
steer visitors to the current version of a file without requiring
them to change their bookmarks.


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>remote, remoteX</b></font><br>

a list of all references that are not to local files.  The
<i>remoteX</i> file lists which html files referer to these
resources.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>skipped, skipX</b></font><br>

a list of all files that were skipped by Linklint.  These are
generally html files which were found to exist but were not checked
further because:

<ol>
<li>they did not match any of the <i>linksets</i> specified, or
<li> they did match one of the <i>-skip</i> expressions, or
<li> more than <i>-limit</i> files had already been checked.
</ol>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>warn, warnX, warnF</b></font><br>

a list of all warnings that were generated during the site check.
Warnings include: unexpected I/O errors, html errors such as
unterminated comments, missing index files (during local site
checks), space characters inside of links, the use of "\" inside of
links, files that are not world readable, mappings that cause
infinite loops, and meta refresh tags that redirect to relative urls.

<p>

For remote site checking warnings are also generated for: files
disallowed by <i>robots.txt</i>, files mapped to a different server,
files that require a username and password (and none was provided),
an invalid username and password, and files mapped to non-http schemes.

<a name="urloutput">
Url-Check Output Files
</a>
</font><blockquote>

<p><font size=4>
Url-Check Summary Files
</font><p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlindex</b></font><br>

an index to all url-check files created. This list differs from the
summary list in two ways. First, it contains entries for every file
written including: host failures, cross referenced lists, and forward
referenced lists. Second, it lacks the detailed divisions by failure
type that exist in the summary.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlsum.txt</b></font><br>

summary of url-check results, similar to what gets printed to the
screen.  The summary list includes an entry for every type of warning
or failure.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urllog.txt</b></font><br>

log of url-check progress, similar to what gets printed to the screen
but also includes extra output created when <i>-db</i> flags are
used.  

<p><font size=4>
Url-Check Data Files
</font><p>


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlfail, urlfailX, urlfailF</b></font><br>

a list of urls that failed due to one of the following errors:

<ul>
<li>could not find ip address
<li>could not connect to host
<li>all timeout errors
<li>had no content (204)
<li>bad request (400)
<li>access forbidden (403)
<li>not found (404)
<li>internal server error (500)
<li>service not implemented on server (501)
<li>server temporarily overloaded (502)
<li>gateway timeout (503)

</ul>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlhost.txt</b></font><br>

a list of all hosts that had failures during the url check.  This
includes: 

<ul>
<li>could not find ip address
<li>could not connect to host
<li>could not open socket
<li>malformed status line
<li>timeout errors
<li>server overloaded (502)
<li>gateway timeout (503)
</ul>

Urls that fail due to host failures can be retried with the
<i>-retry</i> flag if the <b><a href="inputs.html#statuscache">status-cache</a></b> was enabled.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlmod</b></font><br>

a list of all urls that have changed since the last time they were checked
with the <i>-netset</i> flag.  This list is only generated if <i>-netmod</i>
or <i>-netset</i> are specified.

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlmoved</b></font><br>

a list of urls that were reported as <b><a href="instruct.html#redirect">redirected by their server</a></b>.
Often this redirection involves nothing more than adding a trailing
"/" to a directory name.  Sometimes it can be a precursor to a site
changing location permanently.  Some servers report that the url has
been moved temporarily, others will say that the url has been moved
permanently.  A far as I can tell there is no real distinction
between "temporary" and "permanent", they seem to be used
interchangeably.


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlok</b></font><br>

a list of all urls that were found with no errors.  If the <i>-db6</i>
flag is used and the <b><a href="inputs.html#statuscache">status-cache</a></b> is enabled, these entries are expanded
to include the following extra information:

<ul>
<li>ok (200)
<li>ok not modified (304)
<li>ok last-modified date unchanged
<li>ok did not compute checksum
<li>ok checksum matched
</ul>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlskip</b></font><br>

a list of urls that were not checked.  This is most often caused by the
lack of password authorization but could also be due to to an
exceptional condition such as an infinite redirect loop or an unknown
internal Linklint error.


<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>urlwarn, urlwarnX, urlwarnF</b></font><br>

a list of warning messages generated while Linklint was doing a
url-check.  The most common warning tells you the name of a
<i>realm</i> which requires a username and password.
