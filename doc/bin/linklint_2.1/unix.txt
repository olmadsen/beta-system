Unix Installation

  1. Create a directory for the linklint distribution files.
  2. Download linklint.tar or linklint.tar.gz 
     Say ok to warnings from browser and choose "Save File" option.

  3. Un-gzip (if needed)        > gzip -d linklint.tar.gz
  4. Untar                      > tar -xf linklint.tar
  5. Copy linklint to a directory on your path.
     
  You can always run linklint as a Perl script:

  > perl linklint [options]

  If your Perl program is not located at /usr/bin/perl and you want to run
  linklint as a command then you will have to change the first line of 
  linklint to point to your Perl program.  Use the command "which perl" 
  to find out where your Perl program resides.
