<H1> Parse Editor Window</H1>
<P> If you select a fragment group that haven't been parsed (i.e. no .ast[L] file exist, or it's outdated), a prompt will ask you if this should be done.  If you say yes, the source file will be parsed. </P>
<P> If the source file may contain parse errors, a parse errors editor window is automatically displayed.  It looks the following: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/parse-errors-editor.gif></CENTER>
<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="Parse Errors Editor"> </FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> The upper pane will display the list of parse errors, with the first one selected.</P>
<P> The lower pane will contain the source file, with the line with the first parse error selected. </P>
<P> If you press &lt;cr&gt; in the upper pane, the next parse error is selected and the corresponding line displayed in the lower pane. </P>
<P> As in the browser window, you can place the cursor between the two panes, and thereby make the one smaller and the other bigger. </P>
