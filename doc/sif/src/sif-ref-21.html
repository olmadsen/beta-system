<H1> Opening Grammar Files</H1>
<P> Sif can also be used to edit or inspect the available grammars and
corresponding prettyprint specifications. The grammar files of the
Mj&oslash;lner BETA System are normally located in 
<A HREF="../index.html#grammars"><CODE>~beta/grammars</CODE></A>.
</P>

<P> There is a naming convention for the grammar files and the prettyprint specification files. For BETA the grammar file is called beta-meta.gram and the corresponding group file is called beta-meta.ast. The prettyprint specification file for BETA is called beta-pretty.pgram and the corresponding group file  is called beta-pretty.ast. To open the grammar file for BETA the entry beta-meta must be selected. To open the prettyprint specification file for BETA the entry beta-pretty must be selected. The grammar directory contains also a group file called beta.ast but this is for internal use  only.</P>
