<H2> Property Editor</H2>
<P> The property editor is able to edit the properties that can be attached to a fragment group, i.e. properties like ORIGIN, INCLUDE; BODY, MDBODY, OBJFILE, LIBFILE, BETARUN etc. In order to edit the properties of a fragment group, a structure editor supporting a grammar for the 'property language' is used. The property editor is activated in the Fragment menu by means of the Edit Properties command.</P>
