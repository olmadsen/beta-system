<H2> Semantic Errors Viewer Window</H2>
<P> The semantic errors viewer window is opened through the Windows menu in the browser window, or in those tools integrated with the BETA compiler, when a file is compiled and the compiler reports semantic errors.  It appears like the following: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="Semantic Errors Viewer"> 
<GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/edit-code-level7.gif>
</FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> The upper pane contains a list of fragment forms containing semantic errors. </P>
<P> If you press &lt;cr&gt; in the fragment form list, the next fragment form is selected. If you press &lt;cr&gt; in  the lower pane: the semantic error list, the next semantic error is selected. </P>
<P> When a fragment form is selected in the fragment form list, all semantic errors in that fragment form is listed in the semantic error list. </P>
<P> When a semantic error is selected in the semantic error list, the corresponding place in the source code is selected in the code viewer in the browser window: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="A Semantic Error"> 
<GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/edit-code-level8.gif>
</FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> As in the browser window, you can place the cursor between the two panes, and thereby make the one smaller and the other bigger. </P>

<H3> Menus</H3>
<P> The above menus are those supplied by the source browser by default in a semantic errors viewer window.  Integrated tools may define additional semantic errors viewer window menus - please refer to those manuals for details. </P>

<H3> File Menu</H3>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Reload</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Enables reloading the fragment group after a possible rechecking have been done. 
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Close</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD> Entry enables closing the semantic errors viewer window. 
</DL>

<H3> Warnings Menu</H3>
<P> Include is a toggle.  If toggle on, then warnings will be included in the list in the semantic error list.  Otherwise, warnings are not shown. </P>

<H3> Mark Menu</H3>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Mark as Corrected</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Marks the currently selected element in the semantic error list as corrected (indicated by an asterisks &quot;*&quot; in front of the element). This is merely a help to the user during correction of the semantic errors, enabling him to mark those errors, that he thinks he has corrected. 
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Unmark</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Removes such mark on the currently selected element in the semantic error list.
</DL>
