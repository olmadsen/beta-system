<H1> Semantic Errors Viewer Window</H1>
<P> The semantic errors viewer window is opened through the Windows menu in the browser window, or in those tools integrated with the BETA compiler, when a file is compiled and the compiler reports semantic errors.  It appears like the following: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/edit-code-level7.gif></CENTER>
<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="Semantic Errors Viewer"> </FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> The upper pane contains a list of fragment forms containing semantic errors. </P>
<P> If you press &lt;cr&gt; in the fragment form list, the next fragment form is selected. If you press &lt;cr&gt; in  the lower pane: the semantic error list, the next semantic error is selected. </P>
<P> When a fragment form is selected in the fragment form list, all semantic errors in that fragment form is listed in the semantic error list. </P>
<P> When a semantic error is selected in the semantic error list, the corresponding place in the source code is selected in the code viewer in the browser window: </P>

<P> </P>

<P> As in the browser window, you can place the cursor between the two panes, and thereby make the one smaller and the other bigger. </P>
