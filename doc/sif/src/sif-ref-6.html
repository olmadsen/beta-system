<P> The source browser window has 4 important panes. Followed clock-wise from the upper left pane,  the panes  are described below. </P>
<UL>
<LI>Pane 1 is called the project list pane, it contains a list of projects.
<LI>Pane 2  contains a list of fragment groups in the project selected in the project list pane. It is called the fragment group list pane or just group list pane. 
<LI>Pane 3 contains a list of properties and fragment forms of the fragment group selected in the group list pane. It is called a fragment group viewer/editor or just group viewer/editor.  
<LI>Pane 4 displays the BETA code of the fragment form selected in the group viewer. It is called the code viewer/editor<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A></EM>. This code viewer will be seen in many different windows and the functionalities of the viewer is described later. 
</UL>
<P> Below the code viewer/editor pane there are two info panes. Location displays path of the selected fragment group in the group list pane - or in the project list pane, if nothing is selected in the group list pane.</P>
<P> Info displays information, such as &quot;no fragments in the selected project'&quot; or what the source browser currently is doing. </P>
<P> Browsing can be done at basically 3 levels: the project level, the group level or at the code  level.</P>

<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>New...</STRONG></INX>

<DL>
<DT><DD>Makes it possible to create a new fragment group with one fragment form. You can choose between the currently available grammars. A dialog pops up.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>New BETA Program... </STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Creates a minimal BETA program. You are prompted for the name and location of the new fragment group.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>New BETA Library...</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Creates a minimal BETA library. You are prompted for the name and location of the new fragment group.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Open...</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Opens a standard file dialog, and you can now select (a) a project-file (must have extension .pjt), (b) a directory, and (c) a .bet/.ast/.astL file.

</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Save</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If changes have been made to the fragment group, it is saved. A backup of the old text file (if existent) is taken on e.g. foo.bet~ and a new text file is generated e.g. foo.bet.

<H1> View Menu</H1>
<P> </P>
<P> One important quality of Sif is the possibility to present documents at different abstraction levels. Abstract presentation gives a good overview over a document by suppressing irrelevant details. Abstract presentation is provided by means of contractions. A contraction is a special presentation of an sub-AST, where only the root is presented. See also Abstract Presentation in Source Browser Tutorial. If the construct has an associated comment, the comment marker is included in the contraction. Browsing in the document can be done by detailing, i.e. opening the contractions selectively. This is done either by the command Detail or by double-clicking. Abstract presentation can be used to produce documentation such as a interface specifications by saving the document on textual form at different abstraction levels, using the Save Abstract... command. </P>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Abstract</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Contracts the current selection, i.e. presents the current selection as a contraction instead of the full &quot;text&quot;. This can also be done by Ctrl K.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Abstract Recursively</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Traverses the current selection  recursively and contracts those constructs that have a certain syntactic category. This command has only effect if abstraction levels have been specified in the grammar for the particular language. The grammar may specify a list of syntactic categories that automatically shall be contracted. For BETA the syntactic categories are Descriptor, Attributes, and Imperatives, when opening the files in the viewer/editor. For more information on specifying abstraction levels  see <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-14">[MIA 91-14]</A>.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Overview</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Like Abstract Recursively but the current selection  is reestablished after the Abstract Recursively command, i.e. the path from the root to the current selection  is detailed. This command is useful if you want to see the context of the current selection.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Detail</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If the current selection  is a contraction, this operation opens the contraction, i.e. presents the next level of text. A contraction can also be opened by double-clicking on it or by using Ctrl D. If the current selection  is not a contraction any visible contraction in the current selection  will be opened.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Detail Recursively</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Recursively details the contractions in the current selection. 
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Follow Semantic Link</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>During the checking phase a number of semantic links are inserted in the AST. These links are available to the user. Using this command on a name application the semantic link will be followed and the current selection is changed to the appropriate node in the current or another fragment form. Ctrl D or double-click can also be used to activate this command.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Follow Link to Fragment</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Given a SLOT definition, a binding of the definition (i.e. a fragment form with the same name and type) can be searched for. This is done by selecting the SLOT definition and using this command. The editor will now search for a fragment form with the same name in the BODY and MDBODY hierarchy of the group that this fragment is part of. Notice that the binding of Attributes SLOTs may only be found in this way if they are bound in the BODY and MDBODY hierarchy. Ctrl D or double-click can also be used to activate this command.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Follow Link to SLOT</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>The editor searches after a SLOT definition with the same name as the current fragment form along the ORIGIN chain until it finds it or reaches the top, i.e. betaenv.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Zoom In</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Changes the contents of the code viewer  to the current selection, i.e. the root of the AST shown in the editor (the editor root) is changed to the sub-AST, that corresponds to the current selection.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Zoom Out</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Extends the contents of the code viewer to show one level more of the structure, i.e.  the editor root is changed to its father.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Zoom To Full Editor</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Extends the contents of the code viewer to show the whole fragment form, i.e. 
<DT><DD>the editor root is set to the whole AST of the fragment form.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Reprettyprint</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Rebuilds the textual presentation of the AST and reestablishes the current selection. This command can be used if the contents of the code viewer need to be refreshed.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Format...</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Only Win 95/NT. The font in the current code editor can be changed using this command.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Adaptive prettyprinting</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Adaptive prettyprinting can be turned on an off. Default is off.
</DL>
<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Show AST Dump</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>This command is useful for users of the metaprogramming system. It prints in the console window a dump of the sub-AST that corresponds to the current selection

<UL>
<LI>'%' indicating that the current fragment group is locked (cannot be edited)
