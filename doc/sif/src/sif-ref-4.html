<P> The  source browser  that is part of Mjolner, is activated by writing one of the following (UNIX):</P>

<OL>
<LI> mjolner
<LI> mjolner myFragmentGroup
<LI> mjolner myFragmentGroup.bet
<LI> mjolner myFragmentGroup.ast
</OL>
<P> In each case a source browser window appears on the screen.</P>
<P> 1) If there are no arguments to Mjolner the project list pane will show the users home directory and possible projects defined in ~/.ymer.pjt (See Project definitions in this manual)</P>
<P> 2)-4) If the fragment group only has one fragment form, it will a will automatically be opened in the code viewer pane see below.</P>
<P> The structural representation of programs is abstract syntax trees (ASTs), that are stored on .ast files (or .astL files on the PC). The relations between the textual form and the structural form are handled in the following way: if the text file (e.g. the .bet file) is newer than the .ast file, theuser is asked whether the text file should be parsed automatically. If there are parse errors these can be corrected in a parse error editor.</P>
