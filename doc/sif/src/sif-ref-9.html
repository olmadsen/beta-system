<P> </P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/subcodeviewer.gif></CENTER>

<CENTER><FIG LIST="Subviewer Window"> </FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> the code viewer is functionally identical to the code viewer in browser window. </P>
<P> There is no Buffer menu in a subviewer. If double-click in a subviewer implies that another fragment form must be shown, it is shown in another subviewer.</P>
