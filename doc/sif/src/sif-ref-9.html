<H2> Subviewer Window</H2>
<P> The subviewer window offers facilities for viewing (or possibly editing) a given fragment form, independently of any other code editor window.  The subviewer window looks like: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="Subviewer Window"> 
<GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/subcodeviewer.gif>
</FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> the code viewer is functionally identical to the code viewer in browser window. </P>
<P> There is no Buffer menu in a subviewer. If double-click in a subviewer implies that another fragment form must be shown, it is shown in another subviewer.</P>

<H3> Menus</H3>
<P> The above menus are those supplied by the source browser by default in a subviewer window.  Integrated tools may define additional subviewer window menus - please refer to those manuals for details. </P>

<H3> File Menu</H3>
<P> The File menu just contains a Close Ctrl-w entry to enable closing the subviewer window. </P>

<H3> View Menu</H3>
<P> The View menu is identical to the View menu in the browser window. </P>
