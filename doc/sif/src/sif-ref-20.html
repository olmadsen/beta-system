<P> Backup group file:  .ast~ (or .astL~ on PC)</P>
<P> When a fragment group is opened in Sif a backup of, say, foo.ast is taken on foo.ast~.</P>
<P> Auto-save group file:  .ast# (or .astL# on PC)</P>
<P> When a certain number of structure editing operations has been performed, a copy of the fragment group, say, foo.ast is stored on foo.ast# Text editing including parsing is considered as 1 structure editing operation. When a fragment group is being opened in the editor and an auto-save group file exists that is newer than the .ast file, you are asked whether that file should be used instead.</P>
<P> Backup of text file:  .bet~</P>
<P> When a fragment group is saved either by the user or by the compiler, a copy of the corresponding text file, say, foo.bet (if present) is taken on foo.bet~</P>
