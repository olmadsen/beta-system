<H2> Workspace Window</H2>
<P> A workspace window (you can create as many as you want) is a window in which you can view (and possibly edit) fragment forms from different fragment groups (or the same fragment group) together. The workspace window looks like: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="Workspace window"><GIF ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/workspacewindow.gif></FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> When a fragment form has been imported to the workspace through the Import menu, it will be made visible in a view identical to the code viewer in browser window.  The workspace may contain as many such views as you wish. The outer scroller enables you to scroll among the fragment forms in the workspace (try it - it is difficult to describe short). </P>
<P> As in the browser window, you can place the cursor between two views in the outer scroller, and thereby make the one smaller and the other bigger (and zoom the panes, as described in section 5.3.11).  But in the workspace you can even more.  If you press down &lt;shift&gt; while pressing the mouse button, you will only resize the view above the cursor - this is handy for making one view bigger without affecting the other views. </P>

<H3> Menus</H3>
<P> The above menus are those supplied by the source browser by default in a workspace window.  Integrated tools may define additional workspace window menus - please refer to those manuals for details. </P>

<H3> File Menu</H3>
<P> The File menu just contains a Close entry that lets you close the workspace. </P>

<H3> View Menu</H3>
<P> The View menu is identical to the View menu in the browser window. </P>

<H3> Import Menu</H3>

<P> The Import menu will always contain at least one entry.  This entry is the name of the name of the currently selected fragment group in the group list pane in the browser window.  If selected, all fragment forms in that fragment group will be displayed in the workspace.  Following this permanent entry, a variable number of entries are shown.  Each entry corresponds to one fragment form in the currently selected fragment group in the group list pane in the browser window.  If you select one of these entries, the corresponding fragment form will be displayed in the workspace. In the example above all but isEmptyBody and newBody is shown because the others are already imported.</P>

<H3> Scroll Menu</H3>
<P> The Scroll menu will contain one item for each fragment form in the workspace.  If selected, the scroller will scroll such that the fragment form view is visible.  In the example above these 3 fragment forms have been inserted.</P>

<H3> Close Menu</H3>
<P> The Close menu will contain one item for each fragment form in the workspace. If selected, the chosen fragment form view is removed from the workspace. In the example above these 3 fragment forms have been inserted.</P>
