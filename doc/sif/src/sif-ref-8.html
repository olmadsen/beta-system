<H2> Separate Code Viewer Window</H2>
<P> The separate code viewer window offers facilities for viewing (and possibly editing) a given fragment form, independently of any browser window.  The separate code editor window looks like: </P>

<P> </P>
<CENTER><FIG LIST="Separate Code Viewer Window"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/separate-codeviewer.gif></FIG></CENTER>
<P> </P>

<P> the code viewer is functionally identical to the code viewer in browser window. </P>

<H3> Menus</H3>
<P> The above menus are those supplied by the source browser by default in a separate code editor window.  Integrated tools may define additional separate code editor window menus - please refer to those manuals for details. </P>

<H3> File Menu</H3>
<P> The File menu just contains a Close Ctrl-w entry to enable closing the separate code editor window. </P>

<H3> View Menu</H3>
<P> The View menu is identical to the View menu in the browser window. </P>

<H3> Buffers Menu</H3>
<P> The Buffers menu is similar to the variable part of the History menu in the browser window.  It contains one entry for each fragment form, that has been shown in this separate code editor window.</P>
