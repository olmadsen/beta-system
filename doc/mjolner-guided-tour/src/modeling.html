<h2>Getting Started</h2>
When you start the Mj&oslash;lner tool, you will get a window as shown
below. This is the source browser and editor (Sif). When making a diagram
using the diagram editor (Freja) or graphical user interface (GUI) using
the GUI-editor, the source code generated will appear in this window.

<p>To start engineering the application, the part of the real world (referent
system), which need modeling, is to be analyzed. This analysis will be
the basis for the model(Model system). For the purpose of making this model,
use the diagram editor <i>Freja</i> is used. To start up the diagram editor
you click on the menu bar at <b>Diagrams</b> and select <b>New diagram
</b>(as
shown in the picture below).
<p><center><img SRC="images/DiagramMenu.gif" height=114 width=166 align=TEXTTOP></center><p>
You will now bee asked to create a new library file. The library file used
here is called MyShop. After naming the file the Worksheet window will
appear (like illustrated below). With this workSheet it is now possible
to make the model, while the source code is generated in the code editor,
as you will see.

<H2>Modeling</H2>
Now look at the assignment. Which concepts of the bookstore, should be
considered as classes in the model.
<br>Of course the products need to be modeled. Also a shopping cart, should
be modeled. It will now be illustrated how this is done.
<p>To make a class corresponding to the concept product, you first right
click on the <b>MyShop-lib</b> box, Then select <b>New</b> and then <b>Local
class</b>.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/AddNewClass.gif" height=169 width=309></center><p>
A popup window, will now allow you to make your new class. First, I make
the class 'Products' and next make the class 'Shopping Cart'.
<p><center><img SRC="images/NewClass.gif" height=300 width=391 align=TEXTTOP></center><p>
Now lets look at what classifies these concepts, First 'Product': a product
has a name, a price and an unambiguous identification. A virtual shopping
cart, should have a way of keeping track of the products currently in the
cart, and for this shopping cart a total price.
<br>To insert these into the model, you right click on the 'Product' box
select 'New' and then 'Attribute', In this popup window, you can now write
the name, type of the new attribute, The picture below shows how the product
attribute name.
<p><center><img SRC="images/NameAtt.gif" height=225 width=406></center><p>
The rest of the attributes are inserted in exactly the same way. except
for 'productInCart' in the 'Shopping Cart',&nbsp; which is an one-to-many
aggregation between the 'Shopping Cart' and the 'Product'. The way you
make an aggregation, is to select <b>Relations</b> in the menu bar, then
<b>Aggregations.</b>
<p><center><img SRC="images/Aggregation.gif" height=425 width=421></center><p>

In a popup menu like shown above, it will then ask you to give the aggregation
a name. For lack of a better name, here its called 'ProductsInCart'. Then
select the multiplicity of the whole and the part. The multiplicity of
the whole is of cause only one, and the part is one-to-many, which is written
as 1 to *.
<br>If we now take a look of our model, it should look like
<p><center><img SRC="images/ModelNow.gif" height=204 width=349></center><p>

The line from the 'Shopping Cart' attribute ProductsInCart to the 'Product'
class illustrates the one-to-many aggregation between them.
<br>The black bullets on the right side of the boxes indicates a description
connected to the attribute or class. by double clicking on one of the black
dots, a new box appears like shown below. Which is the comment connected
to the attribute 'name'.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/comments.gif" height=106 width=328></center><p>

Now look at the products, which the bookstore wants to sell through
this program: books and CDs. An important information about a book is who
has written it, and for CDs who is the artist, so we need two sub-classes,
one called book and another called CD.
<p>To make a subclass of a superclass. First make the class which is desires
to be the subclasses. This is done like when the 'Products' class was made.
Now make a&nbsp; 'Book' class and a 'CD' class. the defining property about
a book is the author, and artist for a CD, add these attributes to the
new classes, like it was done with the attributes in the 'products' class.
Then use the menu <b>Relations</b> and the <b>specialization</b>,
<p><center><img SRC="images/SpecialMenu.gif" height=171 width=270></center><p>
now left click on the superclass and right click on the subclass. In this
case left click on 'product' and right click on 'book'. Then repeat the
procedure to make 'CD' an subclass of product to. The 'book' and 'CD' classes
are now specialization's of the concept 'product.
<p>The model should now look like:
<p><center><img SRC="images/DiagrambookCD.gif" height=289 width=492></center><p>
A common book store usually have more than one book or CD to sell so the
application needs to keep track of a list of products.
<br>Now look at the model, it is clear that this list should hold both
books and CDs. Here the object oriented language (OOL) comes in handy,
because the concept book is a subpattern of product, and will inherit all
its properties, as well as the concept of CD is a subpattern of product,
which means it is enough to make af list of 'product' objects, then the
list will both hold books and CDs.
<br>In the real world all the products will be in a stock room. So what
we need is a Stock room class. To make it more simple, the stockroom will
always have a copy of the books and CDs, so there is no need to register
to number of copies.
<br>By using the same procedure as with the 'ShoppingCart' class, it's
easy to make this class. Just make a new class, called 'Stockroom', and
make an aggregation, like the one between 'ShoppingCart' and 'product'
only here its between 'Stockroom' and 'product'.
<p>The final model should now look like:

This analysis/modeling is of cause far from complete, but it suffices for
the purpose of showing, how the most general functions of the CASE-tool
Freja works. Now to the design of the graphical user interface (GUI)
