<H2>Introduction</H2>
This online tutorial is based on a fictitious assignment, which will be
described below.&nbsp; The tutorial will demonstrate the Mjolner tool,
by showing how to build an application that solves this assignment.
<br>The application is structured into three parts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyShop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The classes that define the objects in the model
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyGui&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The graphical user interface.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyProgram&nbsp;&nbsp; The main application which
ties the model with the graphical user interface.

<H2>The Assignment</H2>

Picture you got an assignment from a bookstore, to engineer a system,
which customers can use online in the store, to browse through books and
CDs. The customer can then choose from the commodities, and put them into
a virtual shopping cart. When the customer decides to buy, the system will
then send a message to the clerk. The clerk then finds the selected products.
<br>One solution to this assignment, is to make two separate windows (shown
below), one window for administration of the system, in other words adding
new books and CDs, and one window which is the interface to the customer.
To make it simple a perfect world is pictured, in which people never make
mistakes while inserting a new product into the system.

<p>The first screen is the administration part of the program, where new
products can be inserted. On the left is the list of products already in
the system, the right is for inserting new products, and finally the start
button is for starting the customer interface of the program.

<p>The next window is the sales window, where the customer can browse through
the products, and enter them into the virtual shopping cart, which ends
up with a print out at the clerk's desk. The clerk then finds the products,
and make them ready for the customer.
<br>Again the left box is a list of the products from which the customer
can choose. If a product is selected from the list, the box named 'Details'
will give the customer the details. In the bottom right is where the shopping
cart is presented, with a list of items currently in the cart, the total
price, and a button 'Buy Items' which sends the printout to the clerk.
