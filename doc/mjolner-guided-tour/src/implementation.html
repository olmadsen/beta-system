<H2>Implementation</H2>
Now the simple model, and the graphical user interface is finished. It
is now time to put the fragments together and build the final application.
<br>The final element needed is an executable BETA program. The files made
so far are what is called lib files. These files can be seen as personal
additions to the standard patterns and objects in the basic environment
(betaenv), and can be used in the same way in the BETA program, if included.
<p>To make the Beta program, use the source code editor and select <b>New
BETA program</b> in the <b>File</b> menu. This will generate a new BETA
program. Again it will ask for a name, We called it MyProgram.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/NewProgMenu.gif" height=247 width=239></center><p>

If you look at the fragments window in the upper right corner of the
code browser, you will notice that, instead as in the MyShop file (the
model file) and MyGUI file (The GUI file), where it said either <i>lib:
Attributes </i>and <i>Guienvlib: Attributes</i>, it now says <i>Program:
Descriptor</i>.
<p>To include the lib files in MyProgram's environment, they have to be
inserted into the fragment list, which is shown in the upper right corner
of the code editor. This is done by using either <b>Edit ORIGIN, INCLUDE
etc.</b> in the <b>Fragments</b> menu or by simply pressing &lt;CTRL> and
&lt;m>.
<p><center><img SRC="images/HeaderMenu.gif" height=218 width=289></center><p>
A sub editor will appear
<p><center><img SRC="images/headerEditor.gif" height=196 width=508></center><p>

<p>Inserting new text into the fragment list, is now done by first using
the <b>Show Optional Non terminals</b> in the <b>Edit</b> menu or pressing
&lt;CTLR> and &lt;l> this will prompt an non terminal (Non terminals are
always show as &lt;&lt; NonTerminal>>),
<p><center><img SRC="images/hNonTerminal.gif" height=196 width=508></center><p>
in which it is possible to write the the additional text, Highlight the
optional non terminal as shown above, and start writing, the code editor
will then automatically go into <b>Edit text</b> mode, this mode can also
be entered by using the shortcut &lt;CTLR> and &lt;SPACE>. The text which
should be inserted is:
<br>INCLUDE 'MyShop';
<br>INCLUDE 'MyGUI';
<br>To get out of <b>Edit Text </b>mode simply press &lt;CTLR> and &lt;SPACE>
and the fragment list should then look like
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/Headerfin.gif" height=196 width=508></center><p>

When the files are included, this window can now be closed down. And
you should now turn to the code editor.
<p><center><img SRC="images/Sifopstart.gif" height=242 width=647></center><p>

<p>First make the program af subclass of GUIenv, by highlighting the &lt;&lt;Prefixopt>>
like shown above, and writing 'guienv'.
<br>then to make use of the windows designed earlier in this tutorial,
we want to make instances of the first an instance of the sales window.
Now highlight the &lt;&lt;AttributeDeclOpt>> either by using the arrow
buttons or with the mouse. Then write 'MyShopWin: @MyShopWindow;', the
program should now look like this
<p><center><img SRC="images/Kode1.gif" height=100 width=507></center><p>
To insert an instance of the Administration window, highlight like above
and simply press &lt;ENTER>, this will make a new &lt;&lt;AttributeDeclOpt>>,
like shown here
<p><center><img SRC="images/kode2.gif" height=88 width=491></center><p>
To make the instance of the Administration window, simply write as shown
bellow.
<p><center><img SRC="images/Kode3.gif" height=117 width=479></center><p>
Now there is an instance of the MyShopWindow and an instance of the MyAdminWin.These
instances of windows will not be opened without a call to the <i>open </i>method
in the Window pattern.

<H3>Browse Code</H3>
The Code editor, can also be used to browse the code, which will comes
in handy, as soon as the programs gets bigger. In the example above with
the windows, if you are curious about what the <i>open</i> method does.
The normal thing to do is to track the actual window pattern by opening
the files, in which it is inherited from, this can be a time consuming
affair. In this editor simply, double click on either the MyShopWindow
or the MyAdminWindow, and the browser will go to the file in which the
window pattern is declared. Before this can be done the code has to be
checked by Mj&oslash;lner, to do that all the Optional Terminals has to
be removed, this is done by using the shortcut&nbsp; &lt;CTRL> and &lt;n>
to <b>Remove Optional Terminals</b>. When the Terminals have been removed
simply double click on MyAdminWindow. You will be asked if you want to
check the code. If the code is checked the browser will now find the declaration
of the MyAdminWindow, in the 'MyGUI' file.
<p><center><img SRC="images/BrowsAd.gif" height=326 width=375></center><p>
Now the <i>open </i>method can be shown by double clicking on the three
dots, this will show the virtual pattern open. Again if you want to see
the virtual method declaration just double click on open
<p><center><img SRC="images/BrowOpen.gif" height=72 width=147></center><p>
and Mjolner will follow the virtual binding, up the hierarchy.
<br>Now to get back, use the <b>Back</b> shortcut &lt;CTRL> and &lt;b>
or right click and use the menu.
<br>Among many other features, the menu <b>View</b> gives the programmer
the opportunity to make the view of the code as an <b>overview</b>, <b>abstract</b>,
<b>Detail</b>
and <b>Detail Recursively</b>, these features makes it easier to comprehend
and overview large programs.

<H3>Edit Code</H3>
In the startup phase of the implementation of the BETA program, the Optional
Terminals, as used above, is a great help, to make the the program structured
right.
<br>Now look at a do part
<p><center><img SRC="images/ImpOpt.gif" height=106 width=133></center><p>
by right clicking on the optional
<p><center><img SRC="images/ImpOptRight.gif" height=255 width=242></center><p>
A list of imperatives will appear, ex a simple If Imperative, which will
make an the structure for a simple If imperative. Like shown below
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/IfImp.gif" height=120 width=448></center><p>
It is now easy to write the if imperative.
<br>These optionals, as written earlier, is a big help to the programmer
in the startup phase. When the actual programming is finished and only
editing on the code is made, the shortcut &lt;CTLR> and &lt;SPACE> or using
the <b>Edit Text</b> in the <b>Edit</b> menu, will make it possible to
edit the highlighted code.
<p>Good luck with your use of the Mj&oslash;lner tools.

<P>
