<H1> Lecture Series 6:<BR><INX>X Window System Programming Using the Mj&oslash;lner </INX></H1>
<P> The purpose of this Lecture Series is to learn how to use the Mj&oslash;lner System to implement X Window System applications (not using the platform-independent framework, Lidskjalv).  The lectures will focus on construction of advanced user interfaces for X Window System applications.</P>

<H3> <INX>XtEnv Introduction: Purpose, Overview and Structure of an XtEnv Application</INX></H3>
<P> </P>
<P> Readings: <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-16">[MIA 91-16]</A></P>
<P> Notes: XtEnv is an object-oriented BETA interface to the generic Xt widgets for user interface construction under the X Window System.  In this lecture, the architecture of XtEnv is presented along with the general approach to handling events etc. from the user interface.  Furthermore, the patterns of XtEnv are presented.  XtEnv is not useable by themselves, and serious user interface construction demands the use of either AwEnv or MotifEnv (see the next two lectures).</P>
<P> Most often, only one of the following two lectures are included in a given course.</P>

<H3> <INX>AwEnv Patterns</INX></H3>
<P> </P>
<P> Readings: <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-16">[MIA 91-16]</A></P>
<P> Notes: AwEnv is an object-oriented BETA interface to the Athena widgets for user interface construction under the X Window System, based on the XtEnv patterns.  This lecture will present the various AwEnv patterns in details, and present several applications using the AwEnv interface.  The examples are found in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-16">[MIA 91-16]</A>.</P>

<H3> <INX>MotifEnv Patterns</INX></H3>
<P> </P>
<P> Readings: <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-16">[MIA 91-16]</A></P>
<P> Notes: MotifEnv is an object-oriented BETA interface to the Motif widgets for user interface construction under the X Window System, based on the XtEnv patterns.  This lecture will present the various MotifEnv patterns in details, and present several applications using the MotifEnv interface.  The examples are found in <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia91-16">[MIA 91-16]</A>.</P>
