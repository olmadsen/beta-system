<h2>Exercise 2: Browsing code</h2>
In this exercise we will use the program 'minmax' from exercise 1 to illustrate code browsing in the Mjolner tool.


<h3>What is maxint/minint?</h3>

In 'minmax' we use<code> maxint </code> and<code> minint</code>. Find
out how they are defined by marking e.g. maxint and clicking the
Definition button <png src="images/image023.png"> in the toolbar (or
double-click<code> maxint</code>, or press Alt+Right).
<p>
<center><png src="images/image025.png"></center><br>
<p>
Maxint is apparently defined in the file 'betaenv'. Double-click the three dots beside<code> maxint</code>.
<p>
<center><png src="images/image027.png"></center><br>
<p>
Continue the same way with<code> maxint32 </code>to find out the actual value.
<p>
Now we return to 'minmax'. Click the Back button <png src="$BETALIB/bitmap/guienv/backbtn-small.png"> in the toolbar (or right-click and choose 'back', or press Ctrl+Left). Go back until the 'minmax'-program is displayed. 


<h3>Adjust the 'Minimum'-output right and add zero-padding</h3> 

Mark<code> min-&gt;putint </code>and enter text editing mode. Add<code> (# format::&lt; (##) #) </code>to<code> putint </code>as shown:
<p>
<center><png src="images/image031.png"></center><br>
<p>
Double-click<code> format</code>. Because the compiler has not yet checked the text you have just typed, it does not yet know what it means. So answer yes when asked whether to check the program.
<p>
<center><png src="images/image033.png"></center><br>
<p>
Now you can see the attributes of<code> putint</code>, they should be self-explanatory. Further bind<code> putint.format </code>in<code> minmax</code>, so that it prints<code> min </code>right adjusted with width 10 and zero-padding.


<h3>Which containers are available?</h3>

You have probably heard of lists and arraycontainers, but there are many other containers. At the top of the Projects window there is a line that reads 'Std. Libraries/'. Double-click that line or click '+' to open it. Then open 'containers'. 
<p>
Now all the files in ~beta/containers/ are displayed. Browse through the files and inspect the different kinds of containers. There are quite a few of them.
<p>
Whenever you find<code> (*) </code>in a program, it means the program contains a comment at that point. If you double-click the asterisk, the comment is displayed. Double-click again, and the comment is hidden. You can also use Alt+Right or the Definition button <png src="images/image023.png"> in the toolbar.
<p>
If ever you find that too much code is being displayed and you would
like an overview of the program, you can press Alt+Up. This hides all
the details. Double-click to get more details (or mark and press
Alt+Right or click the Definition button <png
src="images/image023.png"> in the toolbar). To show all details in a selection
recursively, press Alt+Down.


<h3>What else is in the Beta system?</h3>

You should know about the files listed below -- have a quick look at them: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>basiclib
<li>directory (interface to directories on a disk)
<li>file (file handling)
<li>math (mathematical computation)
<li>random (random numbers)
<li>guienv
<li>controls (elements for graphical user intefaces, such as buttons, text fields, check-boxes)
<li>stddialogs (standard dialogue elements, such as file dialogues)
<li>persistentstore (for storing objects on disk)
<li>sysutils
<li>envstring (access environment variables, e.g. $USER)
<li>time (handle time and dates)
</ul>
