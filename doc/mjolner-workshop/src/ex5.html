<h2>Exercise 5: Debugging</h2>
In this exercise we will take a brief look at how the Mjolner tool can help you locate errors in your programs.
<p>
Load the file <a href="syntaxedit.bet">syntaxedit.bet</a>.
<p>
Compile <png src="$BETALIB/bitmap/guienv/compbtn-small.png"> and run <png src="$BETALIB/bitmap/guienv/runbtn-small.png"> the program. It contains a 'Reference is none'-error.
<p>
Click the Debug button <png src="$BETALIB/bitmap/guienv/dbgbtn-small.png"> in the toolbar or right click in the code and choose 'Compile/Run-&gt;Debug syntaxedit'. Now a debugging window pops up.


<h3>Reference is none</h3>
Click 'Go' in the debugging window. This time, when the program stops, the window tells you at the bottom that there is an error: 'Reference is none'. And in the Form window the command causing the error is marked (<code>'kg'-&gt;value</code>, which should be<code> 'kg'-&gt;value[]</code>). Close the debugging window, correct the error and run the program again.
<p>
It is that easy to find errors such as 'Reference is none'!


<h3>Break points</h3>
For practice we will insert a breakpoint at<code> 'The car is:'-&gt;putline</code>. Mark this line and right click. Choose 'Set Break' and mark something else (anything).
<p>
Click 'Go' in the debugging window. Now the program runs for a little while and then stops at the break point.
<p>
Click the Object button in the debugging window. This displays the active object, i.e. the object whose do-part is currently being executed. Here, the active object is of course the entire program.
<p>
You can see that the object has a component called <code> aPerson </code>which is an instance of the<code> program.Person </code>pattern. But we already knew that. Now double click that line. Double click<code> Name</code>, and double click<code> T</code>. You can see that the person is Santa Claus. 
<p>
In this manner the object structure can be observed at runtime. Sometimes this is preferable to inserting debug-printlines.
<p>
Now click the break point<code> &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt;</code>, then right click and choose 'Erase Break'. Choose 'Rerun' either from the right click menu or the new window. Now the program is ready to start over.
