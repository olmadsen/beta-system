	<LI>In the source browser select <em>Diagram:New Diagram...</em> to create a new diagram and corresponding source code.
	<LI>In the source browser open a BETA fragment form. Select <em>Diagram:Show Diagram</em> to display a reverse engineered diagram of the code in the fragment form. Note that relations, like specializations and associations, will only be reverse engineered if the fragment has been checked (e.g. using <em>Compile/Run:Check</em>). Also note that if a diagram already exists for the selected fragment this will be opened and possibly be updated.
	<LI>In the source browser open a BETA fragment form. Right-click anywhere in the code editor and select <em>Show Diagram</em> from the popup menu. This will have the same effects as mentioned above.
	<LI>In the source browser select <em>Diagram:Open Diagram...</em>. An <em>Open File</em> dialog is launched. From here select either a diagram file (with .diag extension) or select a BETA fragment file (.ast, astL or .bet extension).
