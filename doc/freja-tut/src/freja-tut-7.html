<H2>The <INX>Notation</INX></H2>
<P> The graphical design notation used in the CASE tool, Freja, is <INX>UML</INX>.</P>
<P> UML is the result of the efforts of Jim Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></EM> to unify their methods: <INX>OMT</INX> (Object Modeling Technique),<INX>Booch</INX> and <INX>OOSE</INX> (Object-Oriented Software Engineering).</P>
<P> The current version of Freja supports Class diagrams.</P>
<P> The class diagrams illustrate the static structure of the model with symbols for class, aggregation, association and specialization. In Freja design diagrams and code are tightly integrated. As a consequence class diagrams can also be seen as an illustration of the static structure of a BETA program. In this sense UML class symbols correspond to BETA patterns, UML aggregations to BETA whole-part and reference compositions and UML specializations to BETA specializations. A symbol that is not directly found as a language construct in BETA is an association.</P>
<P> The most recent updates on the <INX>Unified Modeling Language</INX> are avialable via the worldwide web: http://www.rational.com.</P>
