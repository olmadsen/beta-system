<H1> <A NAME="LINK-freja-tut-_Toc380227604"><A NAME=MARKER-9-50></A>The <A NAME=MARKER-2-52></A>Notation<A NAME=MARKER-9-53></A></A></H1>
<P> The graphical design notation used in the CASE tool, Freja, is UML<A NAME=MARKER-2-55></A>.</P>
<P> UML is the result of the efforts of Jim Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson<EM><A REL=FOOTNOTE HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A></EM> to unify their methods: OMT<A NAME=MARKER-2-56></A> (Object Modeling Technique), Booch<A NAME=MARKER-2-57></A> and OOSE<A NAME=MARKER-2-58></A> (Object-Oriented Software Engineering).</P>
<P> The current version of Freja supports Class diagrams.</P>
<P> The class diagrams illustrate the static structure of the model with symbols for class, aggregation, association and specialization. In Freja design diagrams and code are tightly integrated. As a consequence class diagrams can also be seen as an illustration of the static structure of a BETA program. In this sense UML class symbols correspond to BETA patterns, UML aggregations to BETA whole-part and reference compositions and UML specializations to BETA specializations. A symbol that is not directly found as a language construct in BETA is an association.</P>
<P> The most recent updates on the Unified Modeling Language<A NAME=MARKER-2-59></A> are avialable via the worldwide web: http://www.rational.com.</P>
