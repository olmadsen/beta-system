<H2>Hotspot</H2>
<P> <A NAME=MARKER-2-51></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-52></A>All shapes contain
one special point, called hotspot. The hotspot can be set to any point
in the coordinate system of the shape, but if not explicitly set, the
hotspot equals the last point added to the shape. The hotspot is
especially useful when working with closed splines, e.g. the hotspot
could be set to the center of a circle instead of some irrelevant
control point outside the circle. See the
<A HREF="bifrost-ref-16.html">next section</A> 
for an
application of hotspot. Also, the hotspot is used when the shape is
filled with paint involving rasters, see 
<A HREF="bifrost-ref-18.html">chapter 5</A>.
