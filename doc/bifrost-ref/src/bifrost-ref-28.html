<H2><INX>Picture Coordinate System</INX></H2> <P>
When graphical
objects are composed into a picture, it is necessary to have a mapping
between the coordinate system of the graphical object and the
coordinate system of the picture, since each graphical object is
defined in its own coordinate system and is placed somewhere in the
coordinate system of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The graphical object defines a
transformation from its own coordinate system to the coordinate system
of the picture. Since the coordinate system of the shape is identical
to the coordinate system of the graphical object it is part of, the
transformation actually defines how to position the shape of the
graphical object in the picture. This transformation is described in a
matrix called TM, inherited from the superpattern
AbstractGraphicalObject.

attribute of graphical objects above (<A
