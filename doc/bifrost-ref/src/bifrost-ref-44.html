<H2><INX>Defining New Shapes</INX></H2>
<P> Predefined graphical objects are defined
by describing a shape that defines the outline of the object. This is
done in two steps. First, the additional attributes that specifies the
shape are defined, e.g to define a line shape, the shape defines three
attributes: two end points and a line width. Secondly, the operation
GetShape, that calculates the actual shape in terms of line and spline
segments, is defined.</P>

<P> In practice it could be very difficult or impossible to define the
GetShape operation, e.g. for text. In case the application programmer
wants to utilize special hardware/firmware operations, the Draw and
Erase operations of the graphical object must be specialized together
with a corresponding fill operation of the Paint (cf. <A
HREF="bifrost-ref-44.html">Predefined Paint Operations</A>).</P>

<P> In case GetShape is not written for a particular predefined
graphical object, the following operations must be further bound in
the predefined shape: </P>

<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>GetBounds</INX></B>.
<DD>
Return the enclosing rectangle of the shape.

<DT>
<B><INX>ContainsPoint</INX></B>.
<DD>
Determine whether the entered point is inside the shape.

<DT>
<B><INX>Intersects</INX></B>.
<DD>
Determine whether the shape of the entered graphical object intersects
the shape 

<DT>
<B><INX>Within</INX></B>. 
<DD>
Determine whether the shape of the entered graphical object is totally
inside the shape

<DT>
<B><INX>Transform</INX></B>. 
<DD>
Transform all points of the shape by the transformation matrix.

<DT>
<B><INX>HitControl</INX></B>.
<DD>
Determine whether the entered point is in the neighborhood of one of the control points of the shape. See <A HREF="bifrost-ref-48.html#HEADING48-8">Neighborhood</A> for a definition of neighborhood.

<DT>
<B><INX>InteractiveCreate</INX></B> and <B><INX>InteractiveReshape</INX></B>. 
<DD>
Specify how to interactively create and reshape the shape. See also <A
HREF=bifrost-ref-45.html>Interaction</A>. 

<DT>
<B><INX>HiliteControls</INX></B>, <B><INX>HiliteOutline</INX></B>, <B><INX>HiliteBound</INX></B>
<DD>
Specify how to highlight the shape by using control points, the
outline, or the bounding box, respectively,  of the shape. See also <A
HREF=bifrost-ref-45.html>Interaction</A>. 
</DL>

 <H3>Predefined Paint Operations</H3>
<P> When a graphical object is rendered on a drawing surface, it is
the responsibility of the paint of the graphical object to do the
actual displaying. As stated in <A HREF="bifrost-ref-18.html">The Paint</A>, the rendering is accomplished by filling out a shape. Thus any
paint has an operation FillShape that enters the shape to be
filled.</P> 

<P> To utilize the capacity of the basic graphics system
a predefined shape can be drawn using a different approach. The shapes in
question here could be lines with the minimal line width the output
device can display, ellipses, arcs, and text.</P> <P> To allow an
efficient implementation of the fill operations Bifrost therefore
supplies some additional filling operations for these special
cases. These additional operations are only a supplement, the basic
filling operation FillShape, must be able to handle all
shapes. Bifrost supply the following additional fill operations:</P>


<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>FillLine</INX></B> and <B><INX>FillMultiLine</INX></B>.
<DD>
Draws the entered shape using a line drawing primitive of the basic
graphics system.

<DT>
<B><INX>FillText</INX></B>. 
<DD>
Draws the entered TextShape using the character generator of the basic
graphics system.

<DT>
<B><INX>FillPie</INX></B>, <B><INX>FillArc</INX></B>, <B><INX>FillRect</INX></B>, and <B><INX>FillEllipse</INX></B>.
<DD>
Draws the entered shape using corresponding drawing primitives of the
basic graphics system.
