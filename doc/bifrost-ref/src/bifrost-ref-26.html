<H2>The Picture List</H2>
<P> The concept Picture is a specialization of the concept
GraphicalObject. The reason for this specialization is that the
picture defines a list attribute consisting of graphical objects. Due
to the specialization, the picture is also a graphical object, and can
be added to the list of graphical objects in another Picure. The
effect of this design is that every object in the list can be treated
in an uniform way, without consideration to the actual type of the
object. This is a very elegant foundation for Graphics Modelling<A
NAME=MARKER-2-124></A>. </P>

<P> The graphical objects are stacked (the hexagon being the front
most graphical object):</P>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=0>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>
<P>Stacking graphical objects:</P>
<P> </P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=images/stacking_graphicalobjects.gif></CENTER>
</TD>
<TD><IMG WIDTH=50 SRC=../images/trans5x5.gif></TD>

</TABLE>

<P> When the graphical objects in the list are drawn in a canvas, each
object is put on top of the other objects already drawn. Hence the
graphical objects in the list are stacked relative to each other on
the canvas with respect to their positions in the list. In other
words, the last object in the list is the front most object on the
canvas and the first object is the lowest object on the
canvas. Objects in the end of the list may therefore cover other
objects earlier in the list, depending of the positions of the
objects. The position in the list is therefore important when a
graphical object is manipulated interactively. The subject of
interaction is discussed separately in <A
HREF=bifrost-ref-45.html>Chapter 10</A>.</P>

<P> There are several operations to manipulate the list of graphics
objects and pictures. Two operations are used to add and delete
objects to/from the list:</P>

<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>Add</INX></B>.
<DD>
Takes a graphical object as argument and adds it to the end of the
picture list. 

<DT>
<B><INX>Delete</INX></B>.
<DD>
Takes a graphical object as argument and deletes it from the picture list.
</DL>

<P> Two operations support moving the graphical objects relative to
the other objects in the list:</P> 

<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>BringForward</INX></B>.
<DD>
Accomplished by moving the object to the last position in the list.

<DT>
<B><INX>SendBehind</INX></B>. 
<DD>
Takes a graphical object as argument and draws the object at the
bottom of the canvas. Accomplished by moving the object to the first
position in the list. 
</DL>

<P> Two operations support queries to the graphical objects in the list.</P>

<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>FirstContaining</INX></B> and <B><INX>LastContaining</INX></B>. 
<DD>
Takes a point (in CCS) as argument, and reports the first or last
object containing the point or NONE. 
</DL>

<P> Finally, two operations support scanning through the graphical
objects of the picture.</P> 

<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>ScanGOs</INX></B>
<DD>
Scans through all the graphical objects in the picture, in the order
of the list. 

<DT>
<B><INX>ScanGOsReverse</INX></B>
<DD>
Scans through all graphical objects of the picture in the opposite
order than the list, i.e. from &quot;top&quot; to
&quot;bottom&quot; of the picture. 
</DL>
