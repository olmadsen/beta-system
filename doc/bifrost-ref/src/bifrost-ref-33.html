<H2>Clipping</H2>
<P> <INX>Clipping</INX> is used in graphics system to restrict the area in which graphics operations have effect. For instance, when some part of a window is damaged, the application can clip to the damaged part and then draw the whole window. The result of the clipping is that the system ignores the drawing request outside the clipping area, and the speed of updating is increased significantly.</P>
<P> The canvas supports clipping in the situation where some of the
graphical objects are totally or partly outside the visible shape of
the canvas. The canvas always clips to the visible shape. In addition
to this clipping area it is possible to set another clipping area,
also defined by a shape - the clip shape. <INX>SetClip</INX> and <INX>GetClip</INX> can be
used to set and get the clip shape. The clip shape is especially
useful when damaged areas must be updated, see the next section.</P>
