<H1>Saving Pictures in Files</H1>
<P> </P>
<P> To be able to save and load graphical objects, Bifrost uses Encapsulated PostScript<A NAME=MARKER-2-194></A> files with special comments. This means that a Bifrost application is able to read a PostScript file generated by it self or another Bifrost application.</P>
<P> Ideally we would like to be able to save a number of pictures each as a new page in the PostScript file. This is currently not possible, but the user will be able to save one Bifrost canvas per file.</P>
