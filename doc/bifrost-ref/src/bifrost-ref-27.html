<H2>Selection Picture</H2>
<P> <A NAME=MARKER-2-141></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-142></A>In <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#bifrost92">[Bifrost 92]</A> pp. 78, a detailed description of how the picture is supposed to support graphics modelling can be found. Currently only one form of the graphics modelling properties are implemented, that is, a constraining picture called SelectionPicture.</P>
<P> The SelectionPicture specializes the Add and Delete
operations. When two or more graphical objects are selected the Hilite
and UnHilite operations of the graphical objects are changed from
HiliteControls to HiliteOutline. Graphical objects then become
highlighted by drawing the outlines of the shapes instead of
highlighted control points. This effect is similar to many graphical
editors, e.g. the classical Macintosh program MacDraw.</P>
