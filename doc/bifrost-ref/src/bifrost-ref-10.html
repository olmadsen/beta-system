<P> One can think of a shape as the boundaries of the graphical
object, where the boundaries are made of segments. Straight line
boundaries are made of line segments and curved boundaries of spline
segments. It is possible to combine both line and spline segments in
the construction of a shape, as can be seen in in example in the
margin using four line segments and two spline segments.</P>

<P> As can be seen in <A HREF="#figure_4">Figure 4</A>
 there are three kinds of segments: line,
non-circular spline and circular spline segments. </P>

line segment is a straight line between two end points. A spline
segment is spanned by at least three control points. There are two
kinds of spline segments: an non-circular spline that terminates in
its two extreme control points and a circular spline that do not
touch any of its control points and does not have a start nor an
ending point. Except for the two end points of a non-circular spline,
the control points of a spline segment does not lie on the
curve. Instead the control points are distant to the curve and act
like 'magnets' pulling the curve. 
See 
<A HREF="#figure_5">Figure 5</A>
, which shows examples of the three segment types. The quadratic dots are the control points defining the segments.</P>

<P> It is possible to construct any kind of shape using the three segment types. Any kind of shape with non-curved sides such as triangles, rectangles and polygons with an unlimited number of edges can be constructed from line segments. Circles and ellipses can be represented with circular spline segments. Even objects consisting of a combination of spline and line segments can be constructed. Since shapes represent the outlines of graphical objects, it is possible to construct any kind of graphical object as long as the object has well defined boundaries.</P>
