<H1>Bifrost and Lidskjalv</H1>
<P> As has been mentioned in the previous chapters, the current
implementation of Bifrost is based on the <INX>Lidskjalv User
Interface Toolkit</INX>, also known as <INX>guienv</INX>, see <A
HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia94-27">[MIA 94-27]</A>. As it was
also mentioned in a footnote in the Canvas description, the Canvas
pattern is in the current implementation named
<INX>BifrostCanvas</INX>. This chapter tries to give an overview of
the current situation with respect to such overlaps and
inconsistencies between Lidskjalv and Bifrost. </P>

<P> The Lidskjalv library and the Bifrost library has been designed
independently. This is the reason that there is some overlap in
functionality, in the implementation of Bifrost under Lidskjalv.</P>
