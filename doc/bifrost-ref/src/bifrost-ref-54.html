<H1>Bifrost and Lidskjalv</H1>
<P> As has been mentioned in the previous chapters, the current implementation of Bifrost is based on the Lidskjalv User Interface Toolkit<A NAME=MARKER-2-202></A>, also known as guienv<A NAME=MARKER-2-203></A>, see <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#mia94-27">[MIA 94-27]</A>. As it was also mentioned in a footnote in the Canvas description, the Canvas pattern is in the current implementation named BifrostCanvas<A NAME=MARKER-2-204></A>. This chapter tries to give an overview of the current situation with respect to such overlaps and inconsistencies between Lidskjalv and Bifrost. </P>
<P> The Lidskjalv library and the Bifrost library has been designed independently. This is the reason that there is some overlap in functionality, in the implementation of Bifrost under Lidskjalv.</P>
