<H2>Drawing and Visible Area</H2>
<P> The canvas is a potentially infinitely large <A
NAME=MARKER-2-152></A>drawing area. Hence everything in the canvas is
not necessarily immediately visible on the display device. The canvas
therefore defines a <INX>visible area</INX>, defined by
means of a shape called the <INX>visible shape</INX>. The visible shape is not fixed and can be
reshaped even after graphical objects have been drawn in the
canvas. The visible shape is a view to the canvas. By moving the
visible shape it is possible to view other parts of the canvas, hence
the visible shape can be used to implement scrolling. Notice that the
visible shape is not effected by the surroundings of the canvas,
e.g. by overlapping windows.</P>

<P> In typical drawing applications where the user chooses a part of
the canvas to actually see on the display device, the application
programmer should not consider which part of the canvas is visible,
but should regard all the graphical objects in the canvas as being
visible. The canvas will only draw those graphical objects that are
visible on the device. This is accomplished by clipping and updating
as described in section <A HREF="bifrost-ref-33.html">8.3</A> and <A
HREF="bifrost-ref-34.html">8.4.</A></P>
