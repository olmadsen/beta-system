<H2><INX>SolidColor</INX></H2>
<P> A solid color is specified relative to some color space. In Bifrost, three color spaces are supported, namely RGB, CMY and HSV. These are the color spaces that seems to have the most widespread use in computer graphics (cf., e.g. <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#bifrost92">[Bifrost 92]</A>, <A HREF=bibliography.html#foley90>[Foley 90]</A>). The HSV color space is probably the most intuitive of these, since defining a color in it resembles the way an artist do it. In order to ease the job of the programmer, colors can also be specified using a simple naming model. Of course, it will be possible to extend the color support in Bifrost for other color spaces too, if needed. </P>

<P> The number of colors available at the same time depends on the device used. If no more colors are available, a default color is used.</P>

<H3>Defining Solid Colors</H3>
<P> The following three operations are used to manipulate the
attributes of a SolidColor. All three operations can be used to both
set and get the values of the solid color in the respective color
models:</P> 

<DL>
<DT>
<B><INX>RGBvalues</INX></B>.
<DD>
Enters three integers representing red, green, and blue values, and
changes the SolidColor accordingly. Exits the current red, green, and
blue values. Red, green, and blue values ranges from zero to the value
determined by the constant MaxRGB. 

<DT>
<B><INX>HSVvalues</INX></B>.
<DD>
Like RGBvalues this operation enters three integers. These are
interpreted as hue, saturation and value of the solid color. HSVvalues
exits the hue, saturation, and value of the SolidColor. HSVvalues has
three attributes MaxHue, MaxSat and MaxVal determining the ranges of
hue, saturation and value. MaxHue, MaxSat and MaxVal is DefaultMaxHue,
DefaultMaxSat, and DefaultMaxVal, respectively, by default, but may be
changed by the application programmer.  

<DT>
<B><INX>CMYvalues</INX></B>
<DD>
This is like RGBvalues except that the three values entered and exited
constitute the cyan-magenta-yellow representation of the SolidColor. 
</DL>

<H3>Examples</H3>
<P> The following example illustrates how a column with the complete
color spectrum, can be drawn using the HSV color model. This is done
by stacking thin lines upon each other, having hues 1, 2, ..., MaxHue
respectively (that is MaxHue number of lines in all). Full saturation
and values are used.</P>

     &Line[] -> aLine[];
     aLine.init;
     1 -> aLine.width;
     ((0,h), (100,h)) -> aLine.Coordinates;

     &SolidColor[] -> aSolidColor[] -> aLine.SetPaint;
     (h, MaxSat, MaxVal) -> aSolidColor.HSVvalues;

<P> Notice that it would not suffice to instantiate just one line
object and change the color of this one object, because in Bifrost
each part of an image must correspond to some graphical object that is
inserted into the canvas picture (by the canvas operation
Draw). Changing the color of one line object would result in one line
with changing colors being shown. Also notice that an instance of the
predefined graphical object class Line is used. Predefined graphical
objects are defined in <A HREF="bifrost-ref-36.html">Predefined Shapes
and Graphical Objects</A>.</P>

<P> By combining the different color spaces interesting effects can be
achieved. The following example is an elaboration of the previous
one. The example draws the complementary color spectrum in a column
adjacent to the column described in the previous example.</P>

     &Line[] -> aLine[];
     aLine.init;
     1 -> aLine.width;
     ((0,h), (100,h)) -> aLine.Coordinates;
     &SolidColor[] -> aSolidColor[] -> aLine.SetPaint;
     (h, MaxSat, MaxVal) -> aSolidColor.HSVvalues;
     aLine[] -> aCanvas.draw;

     (* draw the line with complementary color *)
     &Line[] -> aLine[];
     aLine.init;
     1 -> aLine.width;
     ((110,h), (210,h)) -> aLine.Coordinates;
     &SolidColor[] -> anotherSolidColor -> aLine.SetPaint;
     aSolidColor.RGBvalues -> anotherSolidColor.CMYvalues;
     aLine[] -> aCanvas.draw;
for);

<H3>Name Color Model</H3>
<P> An even more intuitive 'color space' than RGB, HSV and CMY is the one used in everyday life: defining the colors simply by naming them. Bifrost support the possibility of specifying a solid color by name by means of a large number of patterns exiting RGB values corresponding to different color names. These patterns are located in the file <A HREF="interfaces/ColorNames.html"><CODE>~beta/bifrost/ColorNames</CODE></A>.</P>

<DL>
<DT>
<B>Name</B>.
<DD>
Enters the new RGB values, and is hence just an alias for setting the
color using RGBvalues. Useful when evaluating one of the color
defining patterns, which exits RGB values corresponding to a given
color name. 
</DL>

<P> The following example illustrates how to draw a circle with center
in (10,10) and radius 25 and filled with solid pink color, using the
simple naming color model.</P>

<BETA>
&Ellipse[] -> anEllipse[];
anEllipse.init;
((10,10),25,25) -> anEllipse.geometry;
&SolidColor[] -> aSolidColor[] -> anEllipse.SetPaint;
pink -> aSolidColor.Name;
anEllipse[] -> aCanvas.draw;
</BETA>



<H3><INX>TiledSolidColor</INX></H3>
<P> A tiled solid color is a solid color
extended with a BitMap. The BitMap will be tiled in the shape before
the SolidColor is applied, and only where the pixel values of the
BitMap is true the SolidColor will be visible. This is the normal
tiling approach. As mentioned in <A HREF="bifrost-ref-19.html">Raster</A> the hotspots of the
BitMap and of the shape being filled, determine the position of the
BitMap within the shape.</P>
