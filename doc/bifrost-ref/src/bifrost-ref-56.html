<H2>Overlapping Data Types</H2>
<P> The Lidskjalv fragment group <INX>graphmath</INX> defines, among other things the following patterns:</P>
<UL>
<LI> <INX>point</INX>
<BR> which is analog to the Bifrost pattern <INX>Point</INX>
<LI> <INX>rectangle</INX>
<BR> which is analog to the Bifrost pattern <INX>Rectangle</INX> 
<LI> <INX>matrix</INX>, <INX>IDmatrix</INX>, <INX>moveMatrix</INX>, <INX>scaleMatrix</INX>, <INX>rotateMatrix</INX>
<BR> which are almost identical to the correspondingly named patterns in Bifrost (they originate from Bifrost)
<LI> <INX>ovalAngle</INX> and <INX>circleAngle</INX>
<BR> which are identical to the <INX>EllipseAngle</INX> and <INX>CircleAngle</INX> patterns of Bifrost (also originating from Bifrost).
</UL>
<P> These overlaps in names may sometimes lead to &quot;Illegal Assignment&quot; errors in compilations, and &quot;Qualification Error&quot; at runtime, if you mix Lidskjalv and Bifrost code. These kind of errors may most times be solved by qualifying the references with either THIS(Guienv) or THIS(Bifrost). </P>
<P> In a future implementation, these attributes will have been replaced by one common set of patterns.</P>
