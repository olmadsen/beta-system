<H2>Overlapping Data Types</H2>
<P> The Lidskjalv fragment group graphmath<A NAME=MARKER-2-206></A> defines, among other things the following patterns:</P>
<UL>
<LI> point<A NAME=MARKER-2-207></A>
<BR> which is analog to the Bifrost pattern Point<A NAME=MARKER-2-208></A> 
<LI> rectangle<A NAME=MARKER-2-209></A>
<BR> which is analog to the Bifrost pattern Rectangle<A NAME=MARKER-2-210></A> 
<LI> matrix<A NAME=MARKER-2-211></A>, IDmatrix<A NAME=MARKER-2-212></A>, moveMatrix<A NAME=MARKER-2-213></A>, scaleMatrix<A NAME=MARKER-2-214></A>, rotateMatrix<A NAME=MARKER-2-215></A>
<BR> which are almost identical to the correspondingly named patterns in Bifrost (they originate from Bifrost)
<LI> ovalAngle<A NAME=MARKER-2-216></A> and circleAngle<A NAME=MARKER-2-217></A>
<BR> which are identical to the EllipseAngle<A NAME=MARKER-2-218></A> and CircleAngle<A NAME=MARKER-2-219></A> patterns of Bifrost (also originating from Bifrost).
</UL>
<P> These overlaps in names may sometimes lead to &quot;Illegal Assignment&quot; errors in compilations, and &quot;Qualification Error&quot; at runtime, if you mix Lidskjalv and Bifrost code. These kind of errors may most times be solved by qualifying the references with either THIS(Guienv) or THIS(Bifrost). </P>
<P> In a future implementation, these attributes will have been replaced by one common set of patterns.</P>
