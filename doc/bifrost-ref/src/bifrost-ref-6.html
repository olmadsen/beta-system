<P> When a graphical object is to be drawn, the points that defines
the outline of the graphical object must be specified in some way,
i.e. where is the shape supposed to be. Bifrost uses standard
Cartesian coordinates for this purpose. Standard <INX>Cartesian
coordinate</INX> subtraction and addition are
supported. The <A HREF="#FIG_coordinates">Figure</A> above illustrates
the <INX>coordinate system</INX> used.</P> 
<P> As shown, an axis-parallel rectangle is described by one point
(upperleft) and two integers (width and height).</P>
