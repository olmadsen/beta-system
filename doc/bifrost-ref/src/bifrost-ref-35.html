<H2><INX>Input Control</INX></H2>
<P> The canvas
models the input in two handlers: the event handler and the
interaction handler. The canvas uses the event handler to receive
general events such as window resizing and updates. Each canvas has
exactly one event handler. The interaction handler is started by
request, e.g., when a new graphical objects is to be created. The
interaction handler is a special-purpose event handler, designed for
fast interaction with the user.</P>

<P> The typical situation is that the event handler polls for input
from the user, and when the user e.g. starts creating a new ellipse by
clicking on a mouse button, the application calls InteractiveCreate
for an ellipse graphical object. Interactive create is implemented
using an interactionhandler.</P>

<P> The event handler is described in this section and the interaction
handler is described in <A HREF=bifrost-ref-45.html>Interaction</A>.</P>

<P> The event handler models the events originating from the basic
graphics system or from user actions by six virtual operations. The
application programmer may then further bind these operations in an
application that uses the Bifrost graphics system.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>OnOpen</B>. 
<DD>Called when the canvas is shown for the first time on the display device.

<DT><B>OnButtonDown</B>.
<DD>Called when the user presses a button on the pointing device.

<DT><B>OnKeyDown</B>. 
<DD>Called when the user hits a key on the keyboard.

<DT><B>OnRefresh</B>. 
<DD>Called when the canvas must be redrawn, e.g. when it is exposed after is has been obscured. The refresh event is typically generated by the basic graphics system (or by the window manager).
<DT><B>OnActivate</B> and <B>OnDeactivate</B>. 
<DD>Called when the canvas is (de)activated. The exact definition of
activation may vary with the device. In a window system, the active
window will normally have its title bar highlighted. The activation
occurs when the window becomes the active window.
