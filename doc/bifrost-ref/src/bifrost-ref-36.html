<H1>Predefined Shapes and Graphical Objects</H1>
<P> A number of <A NAME=MARKER-2-167></A>Predefined shapes and corresponding graphical objects are designed to assist the user of Bifrost. With objects such as lines, circles and text available, the user can create graphics easier and faster than from scratch. Furthermore, the predefined shapes and graphical objects may utilize the underlying graphics system and hardware/firmware operations more efficiently.</P>
<P> The predefined shapes currently implemented in Bifrost are
described in the first seven sections of this chapter. In the last
section it is outlined how the shapes are defined in Bifrost, and how
to define new 'predefined' shapes. The purpose of defining new
'predefined' shapes, is mainly to utilize the underlying graphics
hardware/software. <A HREF="#figure_14">Figure 14</A> illustrates the predefined shape inheritance hierarchy.</P>

<P> As can be seen in 
<A HREF="#figure_14">Figure 14</A>, some of the predefined shapes can be
stroked. The shape will be stroked with StrokeWidth <A
NAME=MARKER-2-168></A>as the line width in case the attribute Stroked
is true. If StrokeWidth is 0 the line width of the shape will be the
smallest possible on the actual output device.</P>
