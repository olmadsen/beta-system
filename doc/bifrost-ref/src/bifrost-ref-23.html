<H2><INX>Graphic Context</INX></H2>
<P> With the graphical object containing enough information to render
itself independent of its surroundings, Bifrost support local graphic
context. <INX>Local context</INX> is defined as the ability of
graphical objects to draw themselves, <A

p. 4. This can very easily and elegantly be designed in an object
oriented imaging model. Using local graphic context can, however, give
rise to overhead if many objects with the same context are drawn
successively: time is wasted by setting the (same) graphics context
each time one of the graphical objects are drawn.  The
contrary to local context, <INX>global graphic context</INX> is not supported in
Bifrost. Instead an intermediate approach between local and global
context, called shared graphic context, is designed but not yet
implemented <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#bifrost92">[Bifrost
