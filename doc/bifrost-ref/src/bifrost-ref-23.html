<H2>Graphic Context</H2>
<P> <A NAME=MARKER-2-94></A><A NAME=MARKER-2-95></A>With the graphical object containing enough information to render itself independent of its surroundings, Bifrost support local graphic context. <A NAME=MARKER-2-96></A>Local context is defined as the ability of graphical objects to draw themselves, <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#bifrost92">[Bifrost 92]</A>  p. 4. This can very easily and elegantly be designed in an object oriented imaging model. Using local graphic context can, however, give rise to overhead if many objects with the same context are drawn successively: time is wasted by setting the (same) graphics context each time one of the graphical objects are drawn. <A NAME=MARKER-2-97></A> The contrary to local context, global graphic context is not supported in Bifrost. Instead an intermediate approach between local and global context, called shared graphic context, is designed but not yet implemented <A HREF="../bibliography/index.html#bifrost92">[Bifrost 92]</A><A NAME=MARKER-2-98></A>  p. 80.</P>
