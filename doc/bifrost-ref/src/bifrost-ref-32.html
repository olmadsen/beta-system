<H2>The Canvas Picture</H2> <P> <A
NAME=MARKER-2-156></A>As mentioned in <A
HREF="bifrost-ref-22.html">chapter 6</A>, the graphical objects drawn
on the canvas are stored in a picture. When a graphical object is to
be shown in a canvas, it is done by invoking the Draw operation of the
canvas, whereby the graphical object is added to the picture of the
canvas and displayed using the draw operation of the graphical
object. It is not allowed, in the current version of Bifrost, to draw
objects in the canvas that is not part of the canvas picture.<EM><A

 For purposes of interaction, it is possible to draw simple objects (lines, rectangles etc) immediately on the canvas without using the canvas picture, see <A HREF=bifrost-ref-45.html>Chapter 10</A>.
