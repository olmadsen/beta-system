<H2>Orientation of Segments</H2>
<P> A segment defines two special control points referencing the first
and the last control point of the segment. These points are called
FirstPoint and LastPoint, respectively. Line segments consist, of
course, only of a FirstPoint and a LastPoint. Spline segments consist
of at least three control points, where FirstPoint and LastPoint
refers to two of the points. In the case of a circular spline
FirstPoint and LastPoint are identical and refer to an arbitrary
control point of the circular spline. In the case of a non-circular
spline FirstPoint and LastPoint refer  to the first and last point in
the spline, respectively. The result of this definition is that a
segment is said to have a direction from FirstPoint to LastPoint. </P>

<P> When segments are used in construction of a shape, the segments
are connected in such a way that LastPoint of a segment is connected
to FirstPoint of the next segment. In this way the shape gets an
orientation. The orientation of the shape is used to determine what is
inside and what is outside of the shape. It is the inside of a shape
that is filled with paint when a graphical object is drawn.</P>
