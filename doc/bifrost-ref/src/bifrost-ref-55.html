<H2>BifrostCanvas and Lidskjalv Canvas</H2>
<P> Both Lidskjalv and Bifrost have a Canvas concept. The Lidskjalv Canvas is designed as a sort of &quot;container&quot; for WindowItems<A NAME=MARKER-2-205></A>. In this respect it resembles the Bifrost Canvas, which can be thought of as a sort of &quot;container&quot; for graphical objects.</P>
<P> The current implementation of Canvas in Bifrost is named BifrostCanvas, and it is a specialization of the Canvas pattern in Lidskjalv. This means that you can combine Bifrost graphics and Lidskjalv window items in a BifrostCanvas.</P>
<P> It is being discussed to rename the Lidskjalv Canvas pattern to another name with a slightly less &quot;graphical&quot; flavor, and to re-rename the BifrostCanvas to Canvas as in the previous non-Lidskjalv based Bifrost implementations. </P>
