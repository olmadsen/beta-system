<P> The canvas
<FOOTNOTE> 
As explained in <A HREF="bifrost-ref-54.html">Bifrost and Lidskjalv</A>, in the
current implementation of Bifrost,  Lidskjalv Canvas is actually named
BifrostCanvas, since there is another pattern in Lidskjalv with the
name Canvas
</FOOTNOTE>
is the drawing surface of the Bifrost graphics system and the connection between Bifrost and the display device. The display device is typically a screen or a window in a window system. In a window system the canvas is a drawing surface inside a window. How the canvas is made a part of a window (borders, scroll bars, close box, etc.) depends on the specific system.</P>
<P> The canvas is very similar to the canvas of an artist, but has properties not comparable to the canvas of an artists, described in the next sections.</P>
