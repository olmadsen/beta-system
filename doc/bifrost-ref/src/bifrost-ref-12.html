<H2><INX>Fill Rules</INX></H2>
<P> Two different approaches can be used to specify what is inside a shape: even-odd fill rule and (non-)zero winding fill rule. The following examples illustrate the two approaches.</P>

<P> <INX>The non-zero winding rule</INX>
determines whether a given point is inside a
shape by (conceptually) drawing a ray from that point to infinity in
any direction and then examine the places where a segment of the shape
crosses the ray. Starting with a count of zero, the count is
incremented each time a segment crosses the ray from left to right and
decremented each time a segment crosses from right to left
<FOOTNOTE>The rule does not specify what to do if a segment coincides with or
is tangent to the ray. Since any ray will do, one may simply choose a
different ray that does not encounter such problem intersections</FOOTNOTE>.

After counting all the
crossings, if the result is zero then the point is outside the shape,
otherwise it is inside. With this rule, a simple convex shape yields
inside and outside as would be expected.</P>

<P> Now consider a five pointed star, drawn with five connected
straight line segments intersecting each other. The entire area
enclosed by the star, including the pentagon in the center, is
considered inside by the non-zero winding rule. For a shape composed
of two concentric circles, if they are both drawn in the same
direction, the areas enclosed by both circles are inside according to
the rule. If they are drawn in opposite directions, only the area
between the two circles is inside according to the rule; the 'hole' is
outside.</P>

<P> <INX>The even-odd rule</INX>
determines whether a given point is inside by
drawing a ray from that point in an arbitrary direction and counting
the number of segments that the ray crosses. If the number is odd the
point is inside; if even, the point is outside. The even-odd rule
yields the same results as the non-zero winding rule for simple
shapes, but different results for more complex ones. For the five
pointed star drawn with five intersecting lines, the even-odd rule
considers the triangular parts to be inside, but the pentagon in the
center to be outside. For the two concentric circles, only the area
between the two circles is inside, regardless of the directions of the
circles.</P>

<P> The non-zero winding rule is more versatile than the even-odd rule
and is the default rule used by Bifrost to determine what is inside
and outside of a shape. Since the even-odd rule is occasionally useful
for special effects or for compatibility with other graphics systems,
optionally, this rule may be used instead.</P>
