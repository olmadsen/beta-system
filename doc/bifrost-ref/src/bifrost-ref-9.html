<H1>The Shape</H1>
<P> <INX>The shape</INX> of a graphical object expresses
the outlines of the holes in the stencil where paint can be pushed
through. Shapes can be arbitrarily complicated within the Stencil
&amp; Paint model. The basic building blocks of the shape are segments
and these are the subject of the following four sections. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent to the segment sections the shape concept is described. The most important properties of the shape are the shape constructing language and the ability to combine shapes and thereby e.g. making holes in shapes. Another important property of the shape is the stroke operation, which transforms the shape into a new shape. </P>
