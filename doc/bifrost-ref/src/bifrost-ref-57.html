<H2>Lidskjalv Graphics and FigureItems</H2>
<P> The Lidskjalv fragment groups graphics<A NAME=MARKER-2-220></A> and figureitems<A NAME=MARKER-2-221></A> contain a simple set of graphics routines to allow for some graphics in Lidskjalv. Both fragments are based on the notation of a Pen, and whereas graphics defines a procedural graphics library with &quot;draw&quot; and &quot;fill&quot; operation (but with no automatic refresh-handling like immediate drawings in the Bifrost Canvas), the figureitems resemble Bifrost predefined graphical objects somewhat. They can be thought of as a simplified &quot;light-weight&quot; graphical library to use as an alternative to Bifrost in Lidskjalv.</P>
<P> Notice, however, that the figureitems in Lidskjalv are present mostly for historical reasons, and that it is being discussed to replace them with the Bifrost equivalents.</P>
