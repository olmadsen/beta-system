<H1>Binary Stream</H1>

The Binary Stream library allows the user to create an <INX>stream</INX> in a
repetition. The stream is kept in memory and can be saved in a file
and restored again.<P> 

Binary Stream allows the user to mix char/shorts/integers in a
single <INX>repetition</INX>. Alignment is handled automatically, but the
repetition contains no type information. This means that you can write
chars, and later read shorts!<P>

Every operation updates the current position automatically.

Binary Stream has the following attributes:
<ul>
<li><INX>put</INX>: appends a char at the end of the stream
<li><INX>putShort</INX>: appends a short
<li><INX>putLong</INX>: appends a long
<li><INX>putText</INX>: appends a text
<li><INX>get</INX>: reads a char at the front of the stream
<li><INX>getShort</INX>: reads a short
<li><INX>getLong</INX>: reads a long
<li><INX>getText</INX>: reads a text, (zero terminated)
<li><INX>save</INX>: stores the repetition in a file.
<li><INX>restore</INX>: reads the repetition from a file. Sets position to start.
<li><INX>fragRestore</INX>: Like restore, but byte 2 to 5 is the length to read.
</ul>

Binary stream has the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li><INX>AccessError</INX>: raised when file is unaccesable (eg. does not exist)
<li><INX>NoSpaceError</INX>: disk full
<li><INX>WriteError</INX>: unable to write to file.
</ul>

In addition to this, the patterns save,restore,fragRestore also has
local exceptions which is also raised.
