<H1>C-String Library</H1>

The C-String library can be used when you need to exchange strings
with program parts that is not written in BETA, eg. system-calls.<P>

A C-string is a null-terminated array of chars.<P>

The strings can be exchanged both ways, that is, you can create
strings (texts) in BETA and give the to a C-function or you can create
a string in C and use it later in BETA.<P>

The C-String pattern has the following attributes:
<UL>
<LI>charptr<A NAME=charptr></A>: an integer, which value points to the string
<LI>init<A NAME=init></A>: allocates space for this string. Default is 256 bytes
<LI>set: if necessary expands the string and copies the chars from a
BETA text object
<LI>get: creates a BETA text object, and copies the c-string.
<LI>getChars<A NAME=getChars></A>: returns the string as a char repetition.
<LI>length: returns length (zero terminated)
<LI>inxPut<A NAME=inxPut></A>: puts a char at a specific position
<LI>inxGet<A NAME=inxGet></A>: receives a char
<LI>toLocal<A NAME=toLocal></A>: converts all newlines to system standard.
<LI>fromLocal<A NAME=fromLocal></A>: conterts system standard end-of-line to newlines
<LI>free<A NAME=free></A>: frees the allocated space. Must be used if init is called twice.
</UL>

The charPtr attribute can also be changed/updated by using the enter and
exit parts of the cstring pattern.<P>

In addition, the library contains declarations for standard C-routines
to manipulate strings. Note that cstring.charptr can be used as argument to these C-routines.
