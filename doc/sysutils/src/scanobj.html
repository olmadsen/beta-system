<H1>Scan Object Library</H1>

This Library contains support for scanning all objects at a point of
time in the execution of any BETA program.<P>

The main pattern is "scanPrefix<A NAME=scanPrefix></A>:"<Br>
<beta>
scanPrefix:
  (# callback:< scanCallback;
     root: ##object;
     printVisited,printOrigin,printSize: @boolean;
  do INNER
  #);
</beta>
If you specialize the 'callback' virtual, it will be
executed once for each object visited, with 'obj'
referring to the object being visited. It will
never be executed for a non-object, such as a
repetition etc.<P>

The pattern variable 'root' is used to select
which objects to visit: an object is visited iff
it is an instance of a specialization of the
pattern denoted by 'root'. If 'root' is NONE,
all objects and non-objects are visited. If
(root## = object##), all objects are visited.<P>

If 'printVisited' is true, a message is printed
describing the pattern of each visited object,
and giving the category of each visited non-object,
such as '[Value Repetition]'.<P>

When 'printVisited' is true, other booleans can be
used to enhance the output for objects: If
'printOrigin' is true, the origin of each
visited object is printed. If 'printSize'
is true, the size in bytes of each visited
object is printed. <P>

If a garbage collection runs during a scan, it
will be aborted with an error message, but the
program continues otherwise unaffected. To
avoid this, try to create as few objects as
possible in callback. (If callback is not
specialized, it will not get called, and no
objects will be created during the scan.)
