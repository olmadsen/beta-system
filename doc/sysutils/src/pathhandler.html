<H1>Pathhandler Library</H1>

The Pathhandler library is used to convert directory names.
It contains the following patterns:
<UL>
<LI>DirectoryChar: Returns the char which the operating system uses as delimiter in path names.
<LI>CurrentDirectory: Returns the pathname of the process working directory.
<LI>scanSearchPath<A NAME=scanSearchPath></A>: Scan the search path of the process calling inner for each path. The user can specify a new path and a new delimiter if needed.
</UL>

<h2>Pathhandler</H2>
The Pathhandler<A NAME=Pathhandler></A> is used to convert paths with the ~beta notation to absolut path names.
It has the following attributes:
<UL>
<LI>BetaLib: returns the path to the installation of the Mj&oslash;lner System. 
<LI>CurrentDirectory: returns the working directory.
<LI>ConvertFilePath: converts a "relative path" relative to a basic and returns the absolut path.
<LI>LocalPath: Given a path and a basis, exit the local path relative to the basis, if possible.
</UL>

The FilenameConverter<A NAME=FilenameConverter></A> is a subpattern of the pathhandler.  This
pathhandler is capable of keeping track of files which have allready
been "converted". ConvertFilePath will return the same pathname every
time the same file is accessed even if the absolute path-names
differs.
