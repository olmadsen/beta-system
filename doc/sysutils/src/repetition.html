<H1>Repetition Object Library</H1>

The Repetition Library contains a single pattern, RepetitionObject<A NAME=RepetitionObject></A>.
This pattern can be used to pass serialized objects around, eg. through sockets.
It has attributes that make it simple to pack different simple data into a single repetition.<P>
It has the following attributes:
<UL>
<LI>initialRange<A NAME=initialRange></A>: Virtual which specifies the initial size of the repetition.
<LI>size: The size of the used space.
<LI>pos: The next position to be used for get or put.
<LI>get: Reads a long from the repetition a the current position.
<LI>getLong: Like get, bug swapping to big endian on little endian machines.
<LI>Peek<A NAME=Peek></A>: Like get but does not update position.
<LI>PeekLong<A NAME=PeekLong></A>: Like getLong but does not update position.
<LI>put: Puts a integer and updates position.
<LI>putLong: Does not update position.
<LI>cheapPut: Like put, but the user must ensure that there is room enough in the repetition.
<LI>cheapPutLong: Like cheapput.
<LI>makeSpace<A NAME=makeSpace></A>: Expands the repetition.
<LI>checkSize: Updates the size to be at least the position - 1. 
<LI>getText: Reads a text from the repetition.
<LI>putText: Writes a text to the repetition. Also expands if neccessary.
<LI>reset: Resets the repetition. Sets pos to the start, but does not clear or frees the space.
<LI>init: Must be called initially.
<LI>checkGet<A NAME=checkGet></A>: Checks that the position is legal, ie. less that size.
<LI>checkGetText<A NAME=checkGetText></A>: Checks that a text can be legally read.
</UL>
