<B>PreciseTime<A NAME=PreciseTime></A></B> As SystemTime but this also returns the millisecond resolution of time. The accurracy is system dependent.<P>
<B>CpuTime<A NAME=CpuTime></A></B> This returns the amount of CPU time in milliseconds used since the first call of Cputime in this program. May not work on all platforms.<P>
<B>FormatTime<A NAME=FormatTime></A></B> This converts a system time integer to a readble text format.
