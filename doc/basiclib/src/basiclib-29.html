<H1> The systemEnv Libraries</H1>
<P> The <INX>systemEnv</INX> libraries define the experimental concurrency system for BETA.  The systemEnv libraries contain five closely related libraries: basicsystemenv.bet, systemenv.bet, and timehandler.bet.</P>
<h2> basicsystemenv</h2>
<P> The basicsyst emenv.bet fragment contains the core of the concurrency system, and is the prime fragment for information on the concurrency facilities.</P>
<h2> systemenv</h2>
<P> The systemenv.bet fragment is to be used if the <INX>concurrency</INX> is to be used in a program that is not using any graphical user interface system, such as the X Window System. Systemenv.bet does not define any new attributes at all.</P>
<h2> timehandler</h2>
<P> The timehandler.bet fragment contains facilities for setting timers in the form of objects to be executed when a given time period have elapsed.</P>
<P> The rest of the chapter will only describe the <INX>basicsystemenv</INX>.bet fragments.  For details on the use of the other fragments, please see the documentation in the interface descriptions.</P>
