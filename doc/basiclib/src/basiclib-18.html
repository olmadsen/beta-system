<H1> The random Library</H1>
<P> This library provides elaborate <INX>random</INX> number generation facilities.  The random library contains random generators with different statistical distributions, such as uniform, normal, binomial and poison distributions.</P>
<P> The library offers facilities for specifying the seeds of the generator by the setsd operation.</P>
<P> The library offers facilities for maintaining up to 32 parallel random generators.</P>
<P> For more details, see the interface descriptions.</P>
<H2> simple random generators: ignlgi and ranf </H2>
<P> The simple random generator most often used (namely the uniform integer random generator) is in this library the ignlgi generator which returns a uniformly distributed integer in the range [1, 2147483562].  It is also available in the ignuin variant which returns a uniformly distributed integer in a range specified by the user.</P>
<P> Another simple and often used random generator is the uniform real random generator which in this library is available as the ranf generator which returns a uniformly distributed real in the range ]0, 1[ (i.e. 0 and 1 are never returned).  The genunf variant returns a uniformly distributed real in a range specified by the user.</P>
