<H1> The betaenv Library</H1>
<P> When programming in BETA, the basic BETA environment betaenv is utilized. This chapter describes how to use the facilities in betaenv. </P>
<P> Betaenv contains several attributes that are used in any BETA program. That is, each BETA program must have betaenv in its origin path. </P>
<P> The patterns in betaenv are divided into several different categories such as character patterns, integer patterns, boolean patterns, control patterns, input/output patterns, stream and exception patterns. </P>
<P> The first section of this chapter describes how betaenv is used in general, while the subsequent sections concern the individual patterns. </P>

<H1> Mjølner System Version</H1>

The mbs_version.bet library implements a few operations which can be
used in BETA programs to test the actual release number of the Mjølner
System.  See the interface files for details.

<H1> Backward compatability</H1>
<P> This version of betaenv contains a few important changes, which are not backward compatible.  The most important are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The text attribute findCh has been renamed to findAll.
<LI>The text attributes copyAppend and copyPrepend have been removed.  To gain the same effect, you can write: 
</UL>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
'...'-&gt;(t.copy).append
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>or
</UL>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
'...'-&gt;(t.copy).prepend
</PRE>
<P> To ease the process of porting your code, we have included a small fragment called betaenvold.bet containing these obsolite facilities.</P>
