<H1>The directory Library</H1>

<P> The <INX>directory</INX> library defines the directory pattern
that is the interface into file directories in a hierarchical file
system. Directory is an abstract pattern, specifying the machine
independent attributes of such directories. Specific subpatterns:
exists for the different machine types such as UNIX and Macintosh
(unixDirectory, respectively macDirectory, see later).</P>

<P> Similar to file, the attributes of directory are divided into two
parts: the disk entry attributes and the directory related
attributes. The disk entry attributes are located in the entry
attribute of directory, whereas the directory related attributes are
ordinary attributes of directory . </P>

<P> The disk entry attributes of directory are the same as for file,
and will therefore not be discussed here (see previous chapter).</P>

<H2>Directory attributes</H2>

<P> The directory related attributes are: entry, name, touch, delete,
createFile, deleteFile, createDir, deleteDir, noOfEntries, empty,
findEntry, and scanEntries. Directory also defines the following
exceptions: entryExistException, dirScanException, dirSearchException,
noSuchException, and notFoundException.</P>
