<H1> Using the directory Fragment</H1>
<P> A program using the directory fragment will have the following structure:</P>
<BETA>
INCLUDE '~beta/basiclib/directory'
--- program: descriptor ---
(# ...
   dir: @directory;
do ...
   '/user/local/lib/beta/basiclib/' -> dir.name;
   dir.scanEntries(# do found.name -> putline #);
...
#)
</BETA>
<A NAME=HEADING28-12></A>
<H1> Listing a directory</H1>
<P> Program showing a simple use of directory: The directory with the path given as argument is scanned, and the names of all the entries are printed with an indication of what type of entry it is. This is done using the select pattern of scanentries. This is a more efficient strategy than using found.entry.isFile etc., possibly correcting for the case that 'd' is not current working directory.</P>
<P> If the path given is not a directory, an exception will be raised:</P>

<BETA SRC="$BETALIB/basiclib/demo/directory/listdir.bet" LIST="listDir.bet">
<P> </P>
