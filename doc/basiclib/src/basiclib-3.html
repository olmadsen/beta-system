<H1> The Basic Libraries</H1>
<P> This document contains documentation of the basic libraries of the Mj&oslash;lner System. It is a programmer's guide. The purpose is to provide the necessary information to the users of the libraries. The facilities are documented by means of the BETA interfaces and examples of how to use the facilities.</P>
<P> This document includes the documentation on the following libraries of the Mj&oslash;lner System:</P>
<UL>
<LI> <INX>betaenv</INX>.bet contains the most basic library of the Mj&oslash;lner System. It contains patterns describing character, integer, streams, exceptions, etc. as well as control patterns and input/output patterns. Most (if not all) BETA programs will use betaenv, either directly or indirectly. 
<LI> <INX>math</INX>.bet contains an interface to standard real functions in BETA. The library contains patterns for mathematical functions: trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponential and logarithmic, floating point manipulation, power, miscellaneous constants.
<LI> <INX>numberio</INX>.bet contains patterns to be used for reading numbers from any input stream, and for writing any number to any output stream. The patterns are able to read and write all numeric types of the BETA language.
<LI> <INX>formatio</INX>.bet contains two patterns for making formatted input and output on any stream.
<LI> <INX>random</INX>.bet contains an elaborate random generator system, containing random generators with many different statistical properties.
<LI> <INX>regexp</INX>.bet contains facilities for working with regular expressions in text strings.
<LI> <INX>file</INX>.bet contains the general interface into files, residing on some file system.
<LI> <INX>directory</INX>.bet contains the general interface into directories on hierarchical file system.
<LI> <INX>systemEnv</INX> defines the experimental concurrency system for BETA.  SystemEnv contain three closely related libraries: basicsystemenv.bet, systemenv.bet, and timehandler.bet. 
<LI> <INX>repStream</INX>.bet contains the definition of a special type of repetitions that has stream-like operations.
<LI> <INX>external</INX>.bet contains the various facilities for enabling BETA programs to interface to external languages, like C and Pascal.
