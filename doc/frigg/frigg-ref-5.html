<h1>
Graphical Editor</h1>
The graphical editor<a NAME="MARKER-2-16"></a> is the part of interface
builder which allows the user interface to be constructed interactively
by direct manipulation of Lidskjalv objects. The figure below shows the
graphical editor on a newly created object.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/newwinfrigg.gif" height=408 width=399></center>

<p>The menubar consists of three menus: File, Edit and Align. There are
two areas inside the graphical editor: The object palette, and the contents
area.
<br><a NAME="HEADING5-4"></a>
<h1>
Creating Items<a NAME="MARKER-2-18"></a></h1>
Items are added to the window by utilizing the palette. An instance of
some item on a palette is created by dragging the item and placing it in
the contents area. The canvas pattern has a border and contains other items
in its local coordinate system.
<p>When an item is dragged from the palette, the border of the receiving
canvas is highlighted to indicate in which canvas the item will belong.
<p>As seen in the figure below the pattern&nbsp; in Lidskjalv, corredponding
to the button is posted below the palette.
<center><img SRC="images/palette.gif" height=123 width=651></center>
These different patterns are described in the Lidskjalv reference manual.
<br><a NAME="HEADING5-11"></a>
<h1>
Moving and Resizing<a NAME="MARKER-2-19"></a></h1>
The items in the graphical editor can be moved and resized simply by dragging
with the mouse. If the item is grabbed in the interior the item is moved,
if it is grabbed near the border it is resized.

<b>Object Inspector</b><a NAME="MARKER-2-32"></a>
<blockquote>The object inspector dialog<a NAME="MARKER-2-39"></a> allows
the layout properties of the objects in the graphical editor to be edited
in a dialog form in contrast to direct manipulation. Most properties can
only be changed via the dialog. The content of the dialog depends on the
selected object. The basic info dialog has the properties that are common
to all objects.</blockquote>

<center><img SRC="images/Objectinsp.gif" height=355 width=347></center>

<blockquote>Name: The name are expected to be a proper BETA identifier,
since this is the name the pattern will given in the source code.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Events: In the Events menu the different event types<a NAME="MARKER-2-33"></a>
of the selected object are listed. When the user clicks on an object, the
virtual procedure "onMouseUp<a NAME="MARKER-2-34"></a>" are executed in
that object. There is a virtual procedure<a NAME="MARKER-2-35"></a> for
each event that the object may receive. Selecting an event, will open a
structure editor (sif editor) on the virtual procedure corresponding to
the selected event type. If the specialization of the virtual procedure
does not yet exist, it is first be created.</blockquote>

<dl>
<dl>Position( x, y) and Size( width , height)<a NAME="MARKER-2-40"></a>:
The position and the size are most easily changed via direct manipulation,
but sometimes it may be easier to enter the precise values via the dialog.
<p>Constraints<a NAME="MARKER-2-42"></a>: The constraints control how the
object reacts when the surrounding object are resized. If the bindleft
is false and bindRight is true, the object will follow the right edge of
the surrounding object without stretching. If bindLeft is true and bindRight
is true, the object will stretch etc.
<p>Border<a NAME="MARKER-2-41"></a>: All objects have a border. The visibility
of the border can be controlled via the "visible" check box. There is different
kinds of shaded border types, that can be selected in the "style" popup
menu.
