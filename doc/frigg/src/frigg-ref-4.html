<H1>GUI Builder</H1>
<H2>How to <INX>Get Started</INX></H2>
Frigg is fully integrated with the <INX>sourcebrowser</INX>
and <INX>structure editor</INX>. When Frigg is started, the
sourcebrowser window is presented to the user. The 'Interfacebuilder' menu
contains commands to create windows that can be edited in a graphical editor.

<b><INX>New Window Library</INX></b>
<dl>
<dd>
This command creates a <INX>new fragmentgroup</INX> that
are setup to contain window definitions. The ORIGIN of the fragmentgroup
are the 'guienvall' fragmentgroup, which includes all of GUIenv (Lidskjalv),
the Mj&oslash;lner BETA user interface framework. The fragmentgroup has
a 'GUIenvLib: attributes' fragment, which therefore can contain specializations
of the window pattern from Lidskjalv. Furthermore a BODY fragmentgroup
is automatically created. This fragmentgroup will contain the private attributes
of the window definitions.</dd>

<dd>
A file dialog prompts for a filename which will be the name of the new
fragment group.</dd>

<dd>
Assuming the name 'foo' is used, the BODY group will have the name 'foobody'.</dd>
</dl>
<b><INX>New Canvas Library</INX></b>
<dl>
<dd>
This command does almost the same as the 'New Window Library' command.
The created fragmentgroup will have a 'windowLib: attributes' fragment,
which can contain canvas specialisations of the window pattern from Lidskjalv.</dd>
</dl>
<b><INX>Edit object</INX></b>
<dl>
<dd>
Selecting "edit" will open a graphical editor on the window pattern that
are currently selected in the structure-editor. The whole pattern definition
must be selected. It is not sufficient to just select the name.</dd>
</dl>
Note: If the fragmentgroup is not <INX>checked</INX>, it
is not always possible for Frigg to recognize the selected pattern as a
user interface object. If the 'Edit' command is disabled, the fragmentgroup
should be checked via the 'Check' command in the 'Tools' menu.
<dl>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<b><INX>Create</INX></b>
<dl>
<dd>
A <INX>specialization of window</INX> or canvas is generated
in the currently selected lib fragment, dependent of the name of the fragment.
If the current fragment is a GUIenvLib fragment, a window will be generated.
If it is a windowLib fragment, a canvas will be generated. The following
dialog are popped up:</dd>
</dl>

<center><img SRC="images/CreateWin.gif" height=105 width=306></center>

<dl>
<dd>
In the 'name' field the <INX>name</INX> of the new window
(or canvas) should be typed in. The name are expected to be a proper BETA
identifier, since this is the name the pattern will given in the source
code.</dd>

<dd>
A <INX>graphical editor</INX> is opened on the newly created
object.</dd>
</dl>
