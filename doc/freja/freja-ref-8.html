<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-37></A>New Graphics Page...
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If other pages are already open invoking this command will create a new page entitled 'Graphics Page p. n'. If no other pages are open at the time where the command is invoked two pages will be created - a graphics page and a group page.
<DT><DD>Graphics pages are as the name implies ment for graphics only. That is all objects appearing on these pages are interpreted as having no other semantics than the purely graphical one. Basically the commands that apply on these pages are the purely graphical ones that can be found in the Create, Makeup and Align menues. Also Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear from the Edit menu applies to single objects, regions and groups of objects on these pages.
<DT><DD>As a special case it should be mentioned that editing pattern and object diagrams as graphics only (i.e. editing the diagrams arbitrarily without this having any consequences on the underlying code) can be done simply by copying such a diagram from a work sheet or an object page and afterwards pasting it onto a graphics page (for an alternative way of editing these diagrams as pure graphics see Load Graphics...).
</DL>
<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-38></A>Open...
</STRONG>
<P> &lt;&lt;fig&gt;&gt;</P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Selecting Open... makes the open dialog popup. From here a .bet, .ast file or .diag file can be selected and opened.
<DT><DD>Selecting a .bet or .ast file will, depending on the category of the selected fragment, result in either a descriptor or attributes diagram on the active worksheet. This class diagram reflects the attributes of the opened fragment. One exception from this should be noted: When a file containing more than one fragmentform is opened the first thing to show up will be the group page with a diagram displaying the fragmentforms of the selected file (see section: 'The Group Page', below). Now, by doubleclicking one of these fragmentforms its attributes can be shown on the active worksheet as described above.
<DT><DD>Selecting a .diag file will open pages containing class diagrams corresponding to the situation in Freja when a save was last performed (see Save and Save As... below). This also has the effect that all the BETA fragments related to the class diagrams shown on these pages are being opened. That is, if the class diagrams on the pages of the opened .diag file are edited and saved hereafter, the related fragments will be edited and saved correspondingly.

<B>Notice</B>: <BR clear=all>
<UL>
<LI> A BETA fragment is said to be related to a class diagram if the class diagram reflects attributes declared in this fragment.
<LI> If the fragments related to a saved .diag file are being edited and saved outside the scope of Freja the .diag file becomes inconsistent with these and therefore the .diag file can no longer be opened. However the only data lost this way will be the layout of the diagrams on the pages, as new diagrams, reflecting the changes, can be generated through opening the .bet or .ast files anew (here-through performing reverse engineering). 
<LI> Only one .diag file can be open at the time, but the different class diagrams on the work sheets can be related to several different BETA fragments.

<DT><DD>If any editing of the diagrams has been done since the last save the user is asked if he wishes to save these changes. Answering yes to this question results in a save to the currently open .diag file.
</DL>
<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-40></A>Save
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Performs a save of all shown diagrams on all open pages to the currently open .diag file.
<DT><DD>This means that the layout of the diagrams on the pages are saved, and that the fragments related to the diagrams are saved to their .bet and .ast files. The .diag file can then later be opened for further browsing and editing and eventually be saved again.
<DT><DD>Notice:
<UL>

</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Initiating the print command will bring up a dialog asking the user to indicate which pages are to be printed. If all pages are to be printed simply select the All field of the dialog.
<DT><DD>Having selected the ok button of the dialog the following string will appear in the xterm from which Freja was originally started: 'Enter name of PostScript file (without .ps): '. Simply do so and both a PostScript and an Encapsulated PostScript version of the print will be available in the directory where Freja was started.
<DT><DD>To this purpose the Freja script sets the environment variable &quot;DesignPrintCommand&quot; to &quot;frejaprinter&quot; if it does not already have a value. Alternatively the &quot;DesignPrintCommand&quot; can be used to specify that Freja is to print directly on a given printer. This can e.g be done like this:
<DT><DD>
<DT><DD><PRE>setenv DesignPrintCommand 'lpr -Pr312'</PRE>
<DT><DD>
<DT><DD>Where lpr -Pr312 is the command for printing on a printer called r312.

<A NAME=MARKER-2-48></A>Load Graphics...
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Makes a dialog popup from which you can choose a file on disc that contains pages that has been saved as graphics form within Freja at an earlier time. Theese pages can now be edited as graphics pages and saved again as pure graphics (see e.g. New Graphics Page...).
<DT><DD>Also if in an earlier session pattern and/or object diagrams where created and saved togther with the code, these diagrams can at a later time be loaded into Freja as graphics only (i.e. without the code). This is done by inoking this menu item and selecting the .diag file (the graphics) that was saved earlier together with the .ast file (the code).
<DT><DD>
<DT><B>Notice:</B><DD><P></P>
<DT><DD> Having loaded a .diag file into Freja as graphics only it is generally not recommended to save this graphics under the same name again - i.e. as a .diag file. This will cause the .diag file to become <A NAME=MARKER-2-49></A>inconsistent with the code saved in the .ast file. That is reverse engineering has to be performed before code and diagram can be edited simultanously again.

<DT><DD>In the general case Cut will remove current focus and put it on the graphical clipboard as a graphics only object.

See Paste for further explanation of when the graphics only clipboard is used and when code is also being pasted.
<DT><P></P><B>Work sheets:</B><DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>Initiating Cut removes the contents of current focus on the active work sheet. The deleted part of the class diagram is moved onto a clipboard and can later be pasted into any other class diagram. Only titles and attributes can be cut from a class diagram (not any of the relations). Performing a Cut with a title of a class diagram as current focus results in the removal of the entire class diagram and the removal of the attribute of which this diagram is a detailed version. Notice that this type of cut will also cut the corresponding code.

If this is the case and a Paste is performed the effect is that the contents of current focus is replaced by the class diagram part on the clipboard and the code is updated correspondingly.
<DT><DD>In this context when cutting or copying with a title of a class diagram as current focus the syntactic category is the same as the syntactic category of the attribute of which the class diagram is a detailed version.

<DT><DD>If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram or the title of a diagram detailed from such an attribute, this command will invoke a dialog in which the name of the attribute can be entered.

<A NAME=MARKER-2-66></A>Open Subeditor
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram or the title of a diagram detailed from such an attribute, this command will invoke a socalled subeditor on the code that corresponds to current focus. The functionality of a subeditor is mainly identical to the functionality of the codeviewer/-editor of the browser window of Sif. Subeditors are therefore typically used when textual structure editing on some part of the code is called for.

<P> The content of the Expand menu is dependent on the current focus.</P>
<P> If current focus is anything else than an attribute of a class diagram it will be empty. </P>
<P> If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram the menu will contain an entry for each language construct that can replace a possible nonterminal in the attribute.</P>
<P> If the attribute that is current focus does not contain a nonterminal the Expand menu will be empty.</P>
<P> Having selected an attribute that does contain a nonterminal choosing one of the entries in the expand menu will result in the nonterminal being replaced with the chosen construct (see below). If the nonterminal in current focus is an optional or a list element the menu will also contain an Empty entry. Choosing this entry will remove the nonterminal.</P>
<P> In some cases the attribute that is current focus will apparently contain more than one nonterminal. For example:</P>
<P>  &lt;&lt;NameDecl&gt;&gt;:  &lt;&lt;ReferenceSpecification&gt;&gt;.</P>
<P> However in these cases the situation will always be that only one of the nonterminals can be replaced by a number of language constructs and all other present nonterminals will be so called lexem nonterminals that can not be further expanded. Therefore the Expand menu will at any time contain the language constructs which are possible replacements for the (single) replaceable nonterminal in the attribute. In the example above &lt;&lt;NameDecl&gt;&gt; is a lexem nonterminal and the replaceable nonterminal determining the contents of the menu is &lt;&lt;ReferenceSpecification&gt;&gt;. To replace a lexem nonterminal like &lt;&lt;NameDecl&gt;&gt; use the <A NAME=MARKER-2-86></A><EM>Edit Name</EM> command of the <EM>Edit </EM>menu.

<DT><DD>To display the contents of the first abstracted object select it and then choose Detail from the menu or you simply double-click the abstracted object. This will result in having the abstracted object displayed on detailed form; that is the objects that are directly contained in the detailed object (in the BETA program) will be displayed inside the box of the detailed object. These objects can now be detailed exactly the same way as the first one etc. - getting a diagram that illustrates the static and dynamic object structure and the creation and call relations between the objects of the initially chosen pattern.
<DT><DD>Notice:
<DT><DD> When an object has been detailed the program automatically does a reprettyprint of the surrounding objects. The intention of this reprettyprint is to preserve the ordering of the objects on screen. In normal cases this works as intentioned, however, some abstracted objects may grow very large when being detailed with the effect that some of the surrounding objects are moved far apart. A help in preventing this to happen can be being aware of the fact that detailed objects only expand to the right and downwards (never to the left or upwards), so only objects residing in these locations may become subject to relocation

<DT><DD>This menu entry is used when initially generating an object diagram. For further details see the Getting Started section.
</DL>
<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
The <A NAME=MARKER-2-224></A>Search Modes
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Having chosen Show Object Diagram, as explained above, the text 'Scanning AST...' will appear in the status field of the menu bar (the field that initially contains the text 'Type: node'). This means that an analysis is being performed on the target program to detect dynamic object generations and operation calls, so that these can be displayed in the resulting object diagram. Those BETA-fragments that are in some way used by the target program (included files, body files etc.) also have to be analysed to give a complete picture of the dynamics of the program. Some programs use a lot of different fragments that themselves use a number of fragments etc. Analysing all these fragments can sometimes be a time-consuming task. Furthermore it may not be necessary to do this to get an object diagram that illustrates the essentials of the program. For this reason you may choose one of three different search modes before choosing Show Object Diagram. The three search modes are:
<DT><DD> <A NAME=MARKER-2-225></A>Local Search: The default search mode. Analysis is only carried out on fragments located in the same directory as the target program or in subdirectories hereof.
<DT><DD> <A NAME=MARKER-2-226></A>Global Search: All fragments used by the target program are analysed.
<DT><DD>&middot; <A NAME=MARKER-2-227></A>Global Search with Confirmation: Like Global Search except that for every included fragment you are asked to confirm if the fragment should be analysed.
<DT><DD>Notice:
<DT><DD> Excluding a fragment from analysis also means excluding all fragments used by this fragment.
<DT><DD>During analysis the fragment that is currently analysed is printed out
<DT><DD>in the xterm from which the program was started.
</DL>
<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-228></A>Filters
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Some programs may have a very complex object creation and/or operation call structure. The illustration of this in the object diagram may result in a very large number of arrows. This again may hinder the user in getting a clear picture of the dynamic structures of the program. To help out in these situations two filters are provided.
<DT><DD><A NAME=MARKER-2-229></A>Toggle Dynamic Creations
<DT><DD>To remove all dynamic creation arrows from an object diagram you choose 
<DT><DD>Toggle Dynamic Creations. To have them displayed again at sometime afterwards you choose Toggle Dynamic Creations once more.  Whether or not a check mark is present before this entry in the menu visualises whether or not dynamic creations are currently shown in the object diagram.  Default is that dynamic creations are displayed in the diagram.
<DT><DD><A NAME=MARKER-2-230></A>Toggle procedure calls
<DT><DD>Same as for Toggle Dynamic Creations.
<DT><DD>Notice:
<DT><DD> The filters on dynamic creations and operation calls work on page level. That is, if you choose Detail on Different Page for some object then both dynamic creations and operation calls will as a default be shown in the diagram on the new page . Afterwards checking out one or both of these will only have an effect on the page currently in focus.
</DL>
<P>  Showing and Hiding Simple Objects</P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Instances of the basic patterns Integer, Char and Boolean are in the context of object diagrams considered to be simple objects. Simple objects are as a default not displayed in the object diagram. It is however possible to have them displayed as follows: Select the detailed object for which you wish to see the simple objects that are part of it. Then choose Show Simple Objects. The result of this is that all simple objects that are part of the chosen detailed object are displayed at the bottom of this. The simple objects of a detailed object can in a similar fashion be hidden again by selecting the detailed object and choosing Hide Simple Objects.
</DL>
<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-231></A>Compact and blowup
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>The objects in the diagram can freely be rearranged (moved) by the user except that objects that are part of another object cannot be moved outside the frame of the surrounding object. While rearranging the objects in some detailed object one might wish for more space to do so; that is to enlarge the rectangle that makes up the detailed object. To do this you select the detailed object and choose <A NAME=MARKER-2-232></A>Blowup. The effect is that the detailed object is enlarged by 10% and the surrounding objects are reprettyprinted accordingly (of course this operation may be repeated until a satisfactory size is obtained).
<DT><DD>If you on the contrary wish to have an object displayed on an as compact form as possible you select a detailed object and choose Compact. Thereby the rectangle of the chosen detailed object and those detailed objects containing it will be made as small as possible.
<DT><DD>Notice:
<DT><DD> You should not resize objects using the standard 'mouse dragging' method as the effect of this will be that all contained objects will also be resized and no reprettyprint will be performed.
<DT><DD> If you move a detailed object all objects that are part of it
<DT><DD>are also moved. This effect can sometimes be a help in detecting which
<DT><DD>objects are part of a detailed object.
