<P> The page title of an object page is on the form 'Object Page p. n', where n is the page number. An object page is a page containing an object diagram. The object diagram on an object page is a reflection of the dynamic aspects of a BETA program. Object diagrams illustrate static and dynamic objects, composition, dynamic object creation and operation calls.</P>
<P> The box that is initially shown on the object page is an entity whose contents corresponds to the objects contained in the object descriptor of the pattern that was chosen to be subject to object diagram generation (in the case where the chosen class diagram represents a BETA program-descriptor the object diagram will simply represent the objects contained in the program).</P>
