<P> If a work sheet with class diagrams is open, choosing <em>Windows:Group Window</em> a page called 'Group Window' will be opened. This page will contain one or more group diagrams.</P>
<P> The number of group diagrams in the Group Window corresponds to the number of currently open BETA fragment groups.</P>
<P> The Group Diagram displays the properties and the fragments defined in the group. The properties and the fragments can be detailed, i.e. shown in detail, by selecting a node and then select Detail in the View menu. The detailing can also be performed by double-clicking on the nodes. By e.g. double-clicking on the lib: Attributes node, the declarations in the fragment will be presented as a class diagram in on a work sheet (if it is already detailed, the detailed version will become current focus). Doubleclicking Origin, Include or Body fields in a group diagram will open that group and bring up a group diagram for it.</P>
