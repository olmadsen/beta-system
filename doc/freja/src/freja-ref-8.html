New Diagram...

<DT><DD>Makes a dialog popup. Entering a file name without extension and clicking ok will result in the creation of a minimal BETA library, which is given the entered file name. The result of this will be a diagram, like the one shown above, showing up on the active work sheet. The title of the diagram is  the name of the new BETA fragment group (the file name: fee) followed by a dash (-) and the name of the new BETA fragment form (lib). The single attribute shown below the title corresponds to the single class attribute of the library:

<DT><DD>Selecting a .bet or .ast file will, depending on the category of the selected fragment, result in either a descriptor or attributes diagram on the active worksheet. This class diagram reflects the attributes of the opened fragment. One exception from this should be noted: When a file containing more than one fragmentform is opened the first thing to show up will be the group page with a diagram displaying the fragmentforms of the selected file (see

<DL>
<DT><DD>Initiating Cut removes the contents of current focus on the active work sheet. The deleted part of the class diagram is moved onto a clipboard and can later be pasted into any other class diagram. Only titles and attributes can be cut from a class diagram (not any of the relations). Performing a Cut with a title of a class diagram as current focus results in the removal of the entire class diagram and the removal of the attribute of which this diagram is a detailed version. Notice that this type of cut will also cut the corresponding code.

</DL>


<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-61></A>Paste Before
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>When current focus is an attribute of a class diagram this command performs an Insert Before followed by a Paste.
</DL>


<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-62></A>Paste
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is part of a class diagram - i.e. a title or an attribute - and if the clipboard contains part of a class diagram, then Paste can only be performed when the contents of current focus and the class diagram part on the clipboard are of exchangeable syntactic categories. If this is the case and a Paste is performed the effect is that the contents of current focus is replaced by the class diagram part on the clipboard and the code is updated correspondingly.
<DT><DD>In this context when cutting or copying with a title of a class diagram as current focus the syntactic category is the same as the syntactic category of the attribute of which the class diagram is a detailed version.
</DL>


<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-63></A>Paste After

<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-65></A>Edit...
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram or the title of a diagram detailed from such an attribute, this command will invoke the appropriate dialog the attribute or class. If a new name is entered, it must be a lexem (i.e. some legal name in BETA). Therefore before accepting it, the name is parsed and if unlegal the dialog will ask the to change it.
</DL>


<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-66></A>Open codeeditor
</STRONG>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram or the title of a diagram detailed from such an attribute, this command will invoke a codeeditor on the code that corresponds to current focus. The functionality of a codeeditor is mainly identical to the functionality of the codeviewer/-editor of the browser window of Sif. Codeeditors are therefore typically used when textual structure editing on some part of the code is called for.
</DL>


<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-67></A>Insert Before

<STRONG CLASS=menuitem>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-68></A>Insert After
