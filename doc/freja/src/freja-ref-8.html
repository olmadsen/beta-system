<DT><DD>Graphics pages are as the name implies ment for graphics only. That is all objects appearing on these pages are interpreted as having no other semantics than the purely graphical one. Basically the commands that apply on these pages are the purely graphical ones that can be found in the <em>Grpahics</em> and <em>Align</em> menues. Also Clear from the Edit menu applies to purely graphical objects (whereas Cut, Copy and Paste regrettably are not yet implemented for these types of objecs).

The deleted part of the class diagram is moved onto a clipboard and can later be pasted into any other class diagram. Only titles and attributes can be cut from a class diagram (not any of the relations). Performing a Cut with a title of a class diagram as current focus results in the removal of the entire class diagram and the removal of the attribute of which this diagram is a detailed version. Notice that this type of cut will also cut the corresponding code.

<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Copy</STRONG></INX>
<DL>

</DL>


<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Paste Before</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>When current focus is an attribute of a class diagram this command performs an Insert Before followed by a Paste.
</DL>


<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Paste</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is part of a class diagram - i.e. a title or an attribute - and if the clipboard contains part of a class diagram, then Paste can only be performed when the contents of current focus and the class diagram part on the clipboard are of exchangeable syntactic categories. If this is the case and a Paste is performed the effect is that the contents of current focus is replaced by the class diagram part on the clipboard and the code is updated correspondingly.
<DT><DD>In this context when cutting or copying with a title of a class diagram as current focus the syntactic category is the same as the syntactic category of the attribute of which the class diagram is a detailed version.
</DL>


<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Paste After</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>When current focus is an attribute of a class diagram this command performs an Insert After followed by a Paste.

<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Edit...</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram or the title of a diagram detailed from such an attribute, this command will invoke the appropriate dialog the attribute or class. If a new name is entered, it must be a lexem (i.e. some legal name in BETA). Therefore before accepting it, the name is parsed and if unlegal the dialog will ask the to change it.
</DL>


<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Open codeeditor</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>If current focus is an attribute of a class diagram or the title of a diagram detailed from such an attribute, this command will invoke a codeeditor on the code that corresponds to current focus. The functionality of a codeeditor is mainly identical to the functionality of the codeviewer/-editor of the browser window of Sif. Codeeditors are therefore typically used when textual structure editing on some part of the code is called for.

<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Insert Before</STRONG></INX>

<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Class...</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>This command basically creates a new class pattern and makes a corresponding class diagram show up on the active work sheet.

<DT><DD>The class is declared in what is called the current fragment diagram.

<INX><STRONG CLASS=menuitem>Operation</STRONG></INX>
<DL>
<DT><DD>This command creates a new operation. It  inserts the new operation in the class where current focus is set. That is, the class diagram which includes the title or attribute which is current focus. This diagram is called the <INX>current diagram</INX>. The user is prompted for a name for the new operation and is furthermore able to decide whether the operation should be declared virtual (virtual, binding of virtual or final binding of virtual).

<DT><DD>When Ok has been clicked, click the left mouse on the source ("whole") of the relation and after that click the right mouse on the destination ("part") of the relation.
<DT><DD>The destination (the part) must either be a class declaration, a virtual class declaration, a binding of a virtual class declaration or a final binding of a virtual class declaration. The destination may either be detailed or not.
<DT><DD>If the source (the whole) of this operation is the title of a class symbol the result will be that a new attribute containing the corresponding code is inserted in the class.

<P>A dialog appears and either vertical or horizontal spacing (or both) can be specified.</P>
<P>In the case of vertical spacing the selected elements are repositioned so that the bottom-most edge (of the bounding box) of one element has a distance corresponding to the specified spacing to the top-most edge (of the bounding box) of the next element.</P>
<P>In the case of horizontal spacing the selected elements are repositioned so that the right-most edge (of the bounding box) of one element has a distance corresponding to the specified spacing to the left-most edge (of the bounding box) of the next element.</P>
