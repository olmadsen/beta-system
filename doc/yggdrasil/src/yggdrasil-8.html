<H1> <A NAME="LINK-yggdrasil-_Toc364700502"><A NAME=MARKER-9-71></A>The Structure of the Context-free Level Interface</A></H1>
<P> The above mentioned patterns that are generated by the metaprogramming system, are all declared local to a specialization of the treelevel<A NAME=MARKER-2-73></A> pattern. That is, the structure of the context-free level interface is:</P>
<PRE CLASS=beta>
ORIGIN '~beta/ast/astlevel'
--- astInterfaceLib: attributes ---
grammarName: treelevel
  (# ...
     (* declaration of the patterns from the grammar *)
     ...
     init::&lt; (# do ... (* some initializations *) ... #)
  #);
</PRE>
<P> Treelevel contains a local AST, grammarAST<A NAME=MARKER-2-74></A>, decribing the grammar and a number of patterns (e.g. newAST, newLexemText, newConst, etc.) for instantiating new ASTs from this grammar, for identifying the version and name of the grammar, and facilities for parsing a text representation into a fragment. Finally, treelevel contains a parser attribute which can be used for parsing a text stream into an AST from the grammar in grammarAST.</P>
<P> The applGram fragment contains a specialization of treeLevel, called applGram. ApplGram makes the necessary setup for using the treelevel interface to any grammar.</P>
<P> In addition patterns are generated which provide easy creation of new ASTs from existing ones. For each nonterminal A of the grammar a generator named NewA is generated. For nonterminals defined by a constructor rule, NewA will as enter parameter take as many ASTs as there are nonterminals on the right side of the rule. It will then exit an A-AST with the enter parameters as sons</P>
