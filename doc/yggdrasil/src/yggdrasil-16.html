<H2>Format of <INX>Source Files</INX></H2>
<P> The source files to be read by the different grammar tools (e.g. pp and sif ) must all start by giving a specification of the fragment form (similar to grammar specifications and pretty-printer specifications).</P>
<P> The fragment form syntax for source files is:</P>
<BETA>
-- name: category: grammar --
</BETA>
<P> where grammar be the name for the grammar for this source file.  Category must be the name of a construction nonterminal in the grammar, and finally name is the name chosen for this fragment form (mostly not significant).  If ': grammar' is omitted, the BETA grammar is assumed.</P>
<P>Please note, that it is important that category is the name of a construction nonterminal, i.e. a nonterminal specified by a construction rule:</P>
<BETA>
category ::= ...;
</BETA>
