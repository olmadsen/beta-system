<P> Many of the tools in the Mj&oslash;lner BETA System are available as generators, such that given a specific grammar for some language, new program development tools may be generated. These tools will offer extensive support of the specific language, such as parsing, pretty-printing, hyper structure editing (including syntax directed editing), and modularization etc. as offered by the fragment system. Finally, the meta programming system is available for that language. </P>
<P> This section will describe how to construct a structured context-free grammar, and generate a new set of program development tools<A NAME=MARKER-2-96></A> that supports this language. The grammar-based tools<A NAME=MARKER-2-97></A> are Parser<A NAME=MARKER-2-98></A>, Pretty-printer<A NAME=MARKER-2-99></A>, Editor<A NAME=MARKER-2-100></A>, Fragment system<A NAME=MARKER-2-101></A>, and the meta programming system. </P>
