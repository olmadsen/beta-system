<H1><INX>Generating a Metaprogramming Interface</INX></H1>
<P> Many of the tools in the Mj&oslash;lner BETA System are available as generators, such that given a specific grammar for some language, new program development tools may be generated. These tools will offer extensive support of the specific language, such as parsing, pretty-printing, hyper structure editing (including syntax directed editing), and modularization etc. as offered by the fragment system. Finally, the meta programming system is available for that language. </P>
<P> This section will describe how to construct a structured context-free grammar, and generate a new set of program development <INX>tools</INX> that supports this language. The <INX>grammar-based tools</INX> are <INX>Parser</INX>, <INX>Pretty-printer</INX>, <INX>Editor</INX>, <INX>Fragment system</INX>, and the meta programming system. </P>
