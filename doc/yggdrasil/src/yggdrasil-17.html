<H1>Fragment and <INX>AST Properties</INX></H1>
<P> The metaprogramming system enables associating properties with each fragment and with the individual nodes in an AST. The fragment properties are defined as part of the fragment syntax (e.g. the <INX>ORIGIN</INX>and <INX>INCLUDE</INX>properties). The AST properties may be attached to the nodes by metaprogramming tools.</P>
<P> The properties are defined as instances of the <INX>propertyList</INX> pattern (defined in the property fragment). Properties are lists of (name, parameterList) pairs. Name may be any text string, and parameterList is a list of values, where each value may be an integer, a textstring or a name (also a textstring).</P>
<P> The attributes of propertyList are: addProp, findProp, deleteProp, scanProp and getProp.</P>
<P> The fragment properties are available through the prop attribute of the fragment pattern. The AST properties may be accessed through the following attributes of the AST pattern: setCommentProp, getCommentProp and hasCommentProp. SetCommentProp makes it possible to associate a propertyList with an AST, and getCommentProp makes it possible to gain access to the propertyList associated with an AST, and finally hasCommentProp is used for testing whether a propertyList is currently associated with an AST.</P>
<P> Please note, that the current implementation of properties of ASTs implies that the properties replaces any comments, which might have been associated with the AST.</P>
