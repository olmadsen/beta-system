<H2><A NAME="grammar">Grammar</A></H2>

The grammar used by bidl to parse IDL files
is constructed using the CORBA IDL specification
(see <A HREF="references.html#corba_spec">[CORBASPEC]</A>, section 3.4), and adapting
it for the extensions mentioned in <A
HREF="references.html#com_idl_ext">[IDLEXT]</A>.
Finally we had to make several adaptions from the 
<A HREF="references.html#midl">[MIDL]</A> specification from Microsoft.
<P>
The current grammar can be seen in 
<A HREF="../grammars/idl.html" target=new>IDL Grammar</A> (will open in a separate window).
<P>
It should be noticed that this is not a strict IDL grammar - it will
probably accept much more IDL files (gramatically) than are accepted
by <A HREF="midl">[MIDL]</A>. This is one of the reasons for requiring
that the IDL files are accepted by MIDL before applying
<CODE>bidl</CODE> on them.
<P>
Also it should be noted that the MIDL grammar has not been available
in a complete version. So most of the grammar has been constructed by
appliying it to concrete IDL files from Microsoft and changing the
grammar
until the files could be parsed. Currently all IDL files from the
Microsoft Platform SDK are accepted by <CODE>bidl</CODE>
(with a few exceptions, see <A HREF="limitations">limitations</A>),
but it is uncertain whether all other IDL files currently accepted by 
MIDL will be parsed by <CODE>bidl</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="dogram">Processing IDL Grammar</A></H3>

Currently there is a bug in the Mjølner grammar tools,
which means that <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> is <EM>not</EM> allowed in
languages handled by the grammar tools. Since <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE>
is used for specifying constant expressions in IDL, a work-around
has been needed.
Thus when processing the IDL grammer, it should be done as follows
(requires <CODE>perl</CODE>):
<PRE>
cd BETALIB/grammar/idl
perl do-idl-gram.perl
</PRE>
