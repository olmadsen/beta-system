<H2><A name="reserved">Reserved Words</A></H2>
A number of words are reserved to bidl, and are treated specially.

<H3>Grammatically reserved BETA words</H3>

In the generated BETA files, occurences of the following words 
(in any case) are
substituted by the word with underscore ('_') prepended.
The reason for this is that the words are reserved in the BETA
grammar.

<OL>
<LI>enter
<LI>exit
<LI>do
<LI>for
<LI>repeat
<LI>if
<LI>restart
<LI>inner
<LI>suspend
<LI>code
<LI>then
<LI>else
<LI>tos
<LI>this
<LI>or
<LI>xor
<LI>div
<LI>mod
<LI>and
<LI>not
<LI>NONE
</OL>

<H3>Reserved BETA patterns</H3>

The following are names of predefined pattern
from <CODE>betaenv</CODE>, which it is allowd, but very
confusing to redefine. <CODE>bidl</CODE> renames identifiers
with these names by prepending an underscore.

<OL>
<LI>integer
<LI>shortInt
<LI>char
<LI>boolean
<LI>false
<LI>true
<LI>real
<LI>int8
<LI>int8u
<LI>int16
<LI>int16u
<LI>int32
<LI>int32u
<LI>int64
<LI>int64u
<LI>wchar
<LI>COM
<LI>Holder 
</OL>


<H3>Grammatically reserved IDL words</H3>
The following words (in this case) are reserved in the IDL grammar
used by bidl, and thus cannot appear as e.g. a function name in an IDL
file. These words are also reserved for e.g. MIDL.

<OL>
<LI>__stdcall
<LI>_stdcall
<LI>any
<LI>attribute
<LI>boolean
<LI>case
<LI>char
<LI>coclass
<LI>const
<LI>context
<LI>cpp_quote
<LI>dispinterface
<LI>double
<LI>enum
<LI>exception
<LI>float
<LI>hyper
<LI>import
<LI>importlib
<LI>int
<LI>interface
<LI>library
<LI>long
<LI>methods
<LI>module
<LI>octet
<LI>properties
<LI>raises
<LI>sequence
<LI>short
<LI>signed
<LI>small
<LI>struct
<LI>switch
<LI>typedef
<LI>union
<LI>unsigned
<LI>void
</OL>


The following words are currently also reserved in the IDL grammar
used by bidl. They ought not to be...

<OL>
<LI>default
<LI>readonly
<LI>uuid
</OL>


<H3>Internal bidl words</H3>

Some words are used internally by bidl. E.g. the HRESULT exit
parameter of a function is always called <CODE>result</CODE>. If an enter
parameter is also called result, this will give an error.
