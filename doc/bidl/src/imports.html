<H2><A NAME="imports">Handling of Imports</A></H2>

If 
<PRE>
import "foo.idl";
</PRE>
is met in an IDL file
<CODE>bidl</CODE>
opens <CODE>foo.idl</CODE> and find all the types defined in
that file, for using it in the current file. Also in the BETA file
generated for the importing file, 
<PRE>
INCLUDE 'foo';
</PRE>
is generated.
<P>
<CODE>bidl</CODE> has a limited search algorithm for imported files 
(which are nomally not specified by full path): If bidl does not find
the imported file in the directory where the importing file resides,
<CODE>bidl</CODE> searches for the imported file in 
<CODE>~beta/comlib</CODE>. If the file is not found there, the import
is ignored.
<P>
<STRONG>NOTICE</STRONG>: On UNIX, the case of the imported files
is significant. And unfortunately the IDL files coming from
the Windows world often use another case for importing than then
file name actually is (since it does not matter to the Windows 
file system).
