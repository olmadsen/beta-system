<H2> Using the unixFile Fragment</H2>
<P> A program using the <INX>unixFile</INX> fragment will have the following structure:</P>
<BETA>
INCLUDE '~beta/unixlib/unixFile'
--- program: descriptor ---
(# ...
   uf: @unixFile;
do ...
   ('a','r') -> uf.entry.permission.add;
   ...
#)
</BETA>
<A NAME=HEADING4-11></A>
<H3> Unix Entry Example</H3>
<P> An example of using unixEntry: First the user is asked if symbolic links should be followed or not. If the unixEntry specified on the command line exists, it is then various other UNIX specific attributes are examined. It is examined whether the entry is a <INX>symbolic</INX> <INX>link</INX> or not, only if links should not be followed.</P>
<P> Finally it is attempted to change the owner of it to 675: </P>

<BETA LIST="unixentry.bet" SRC="$BETALIB/unixlib/demo/unixfile/unixentry.bet">

<A NAME=HEADING4-66></A>
<H3> Split executable file</H3>
<P> A simple example of using unixFile: The file 'in.bet' is read word by word, and each word is printed on the output file specified on the command line. This output file has been opened with openExeWrite, meaning that the resulting file will be executable. After this, the output file is opened again, this time with openExeAppend, meaning that the output file will be executable after the line of text has been appended to it.: </P>
