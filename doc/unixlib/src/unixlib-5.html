<H1> The unixDirectory Library</H1>
<P> The unixDirectory<A NAME=MARKER-2-4></A> library defines the UNIX specific properties of the disk entry attributes and <A NAME=MARKER-directory>directory</A> related attributes of UNIX directories. This is done through specializations of the diskEntry and file patterns, namely the unixEntry and unixDirectory patterns.</P>

<h3>unixDirectory attributes</H3>
<P> The unixEntry pattern is the same as the one discussed in the unixFile library, and the unixDirectory pattern only makes the necessary specializations to make the inherited directory properties function on the UNIX hierarchical file system.</P>
