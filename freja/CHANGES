toby 280596: 	Update to basiclib/v1.5
toby 140695:	Menu bodies and external Sif event bodies handles all
		types of pages (OADPage, ObjectPage, Page), preventing
		qua-error.
		Search moved from Edit menu to View menu to resemble Sif.
		Cut, copy and paste works on all types of pages (except
		for semantic copy of objects in object diagrams) and
		between the different types of pages. This enables user
		to copy e.g. pattern diagram to (newly implemented) graphics
		page and edit it as graphics only. Notice: pattern diagrams
		can not directly be pasted as graphics to Work sheets. This
		is to prevent user confusing semantic with non-semantic
		objects.

		combinations of groups and regions.
