VERSION 2.2
=============
With v2.2 the following changes were introduced:


freja.bet:
==========
toby 280596: 	Update to basiclib/v1.5

toby 140696:	Menu bodies and external Sif event bodies handles all
		types of pages (OADPage, ObjectPage, Page), preventing
		qua-error.
		Search moved from Edit menu to View menu to resemble Sif.
		Cut, copy and paste works on all types of pages (except
		for semantic copy of objects in object diagrams) and
		between the different types of pages. This enables user
		to copy e.g. pattern diagram to (newly implemented) graphics
		page and edit it as graphics only. Notice: pattern diagrams
		can not directly be pasted as graphics to Work sheets. This
		is to prevent user confusing semantic with non-semantic
		objects.

toby 150806:	On Freja startup Sif is Hidden.
		Almost all dialogs are now GuiEnv dialogs (also before
		document initialization) - not designOA dialogs.
		All settings regarding layout are now controlled via
		a layout preferences dialog.


frejamenu.bet:
==============
toby 280596: 	Update to basiclib/v1.5

toby 140696:	Menu bodies handles all	types of pages (OADPage, ObjectPage,
		Page), preventing qua-error.
		Arbitrary hierarchies of regions can be cut, copy and pasted
		(necessary to enable copying of object diagrams to graphics
		pages).
		Implemented cut, copy and paste of connectors in arbitrary
		combinations of groups and regions.

toby 150896:	If a connector only is on the clipboard paste is now
		possible.
		Almost all dialogs are now GuiEnv dialogs (also before
		document initialization) - not designOA dialogs.
		On 'New Pattern' or 'local Pattern' 'Edit Name' is
		automatically invoked.
