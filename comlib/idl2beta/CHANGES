PA: 7/11/97:	Created initial verion based on runtime-system meta
		generator, and using grammar
		  ~beta/r4.1/grammars/idl/v2.0/idl-meta.gram 
		Had to change a few things in the grammar: A few
		reserved words were used in the idlcfl.bet (div, mod,
		...), and a couple of places, the same nonterminal was
		used twice on a right-side, resulting in multiple
		defined names. Added tags in these cases.

		Known problems: One-line comments starting with //
		cannot be parsed.

		Current file structure:

		     bidl.bet			main program (PROGRAM SLOT)
		     control.bet		argument parsing, file
						opening etc.
		     idlsematt.bet		semantic level -
						currently identical to
						context free level
		     outfile.bet		encapsulation of
						output file. Should
						could model both a
						.bet and an AST file
		     translate.bet		Traversal of asts with
						translation to BETA
		     private/
		       betaoutfilebody.bet	body file for .bet
						file production

		Currently the division between .ast and .bet file
		production is not done correctly. The first version
		will be coded for .bet file production only - should
		be cleaned up later!

		Also translate.bet will quicly become too
		large. Should be fragmented.
	
PA: 10/11/97:	Fixed problem with one-line comments:
		Parsed had to be initialized with EOLasComEnd
		furtherbound to be true.
		Work on do_interface_header.
		And managed to get comments from the IDL files
		propagated into the generated .bet files.

		Identified problems:
		1. Leading zeros in UUID's seems to be missing in the
		   IDL-asts.
		   Can be fixed by collection the digits in an integer
		   (16 based), and printing them out using puxhex.
		   (NOTICE: puthex in r4.1 does not work on little
		   endian!)
		   
		2. The idl-grammar specifies that a list of
		   names may be specified for inheritance in the
		   header. This means multiple inheritance!
		   I do not know if this occurs in actual IDL files,
		   but we may run into a problem here later.
		   

		3. During parsing of an IDL file, I get the message
		     grammarTable.meta is NONE
		   This does not seem to influence behaviour, but it
		   worries me a little!

PA: 11/11/97:   Fixed do_inheritance_spec.
		Will stop program, if multiple inheritance is used.
		Added support for 'bidl *.idl' in control.bet.
		Fixed UUID decoding: Using Const.GetText instead of
		Const.GetValue fixed the problem.

PA: 13/11/97:   Moved some more stuff down into betaoutfilebody,
		mainly because beta-code in strings confuse beta-mode
		(in emacs) a lot! Having these bits of code in small
		fragments help a lot.
		Fixed most remaining parts of do_interface_header, and
		started on do_interface_body.
		Got to the parameters and exit types.

PA: 17/11/97:	A lot of work on parameters and return types.
		Now objidl.idl can be generated into an almost
		complete BETA interface.
		A few parameter types are missing, but the most
		significan remaining parts (judged from objidl alone)
		are handling of typedefs and import.
		Currently #ifdef's are parsed up to become comments.
		And there are typically #ifdefs around typedefs and
		imports, so we will have to figure out a solution
		here.

PA: 18/11/97:	Added comment to attributes, which should really be
		references (*^*) or references-to-references (*^^*).
		We must figure out a way to handle these later.
		Added const_exp.bet, which translates category
		const_exp (f...ing 200 lines of code for this. And the
		Ast-traversal routines could be almost automatically 
		generated by MPS (as far as I can see) (:-().
		const_exp is used in size_is attributes.
		Changed do_declarator, so that it can be used by 
		do_length_is too.
		Fragmented do_interface_header and do_interface_body
		into two separate files.
		Created type_dcl.bet for implementation of
		typedef's etc.

PA: 18/11/97:	Moved some mps additions from translate.bet into
		a new file mpsadditions.bet.

PA: 19/11/97:	Changed do_declarator to enter an info record instead
		of modifying global variables.
		Moved it to a separate file.
		Moved do_attributeY to separate file.
		Implemented basic typedefs. Major ones missing:
		enums and structs.
		All names, that are pointers, are now suffixed
		with '_Ref' and pointer_to_pointer are suffixed with
		'_RefRef'. That is, we will need to generate patterns
		a la UCHAR_Ref, UCHAR_RefRef, IMalloc_Ref,
		IMalloc_RefRef etc.
		These must resemble the "HOLDER" classes used in 
		IDL-to-Java mapping.
		Started on do_enum_type. Works almost, but apparently
		my do_const_exp on the constant 0x0001 returns 0 (:-(

PA: 20/11/97:	Fixed do_const_exp: Was because ConstToText should be
		used instead of ConstToInteger.
		Enum translation now seems to work.
		They are generated as constants (or as constant
		expressions). I would have liked to generate them as
		typed patterns (IntegerObject
		specialization). However, if an enum is used as a
		formal parameter in an external call, this will be a
		problem, since these may only be simple types.

PA: 25/11/97:	Added test/chapter10.idl, from the Inside COM book.
		Cannot be parsed by current grammar!
		Added import and helpstring to the grammar.
		Added various optional semicolons to the grammar.
		However, had to remove these again, since objidl.idl
		would now not parse (:-(

PA: 26/11/97:	Fixed one of the optional colons.
		Changed in translate.bet: I do not anymore use 
		ast.top.open, but instead call the parser on the idl
		file directly. This means, that additional fragment
		syntax does not need to be inserted in the idl files.
		It also means, that there is no longer saved AST files
		corresponding to the IDL files, so the .bet file can
		be named just like the idl file, without '-beta'
		addition.
		This also eliminated the 'grammarTable.meta is NONE'
		warning, which originated from top.open.
		Changed <iversion> in grammar to include the version
		specification.
		Added categories <library>, <coclass>, <importlib>.
		<coclass> was tricky! 
		No code is generated for these in the translation to
		BETA. 

PA: 27/11/98:	Fixed do_struct_type. chapter10.idl now translates
		without remaining parts.
