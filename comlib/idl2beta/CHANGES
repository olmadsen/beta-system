PA: 7/11/97:	Created initial verion based on runtime-system meta
		generator, and using grammar
		  ~beta/r4.1/grammars/idl/v2.0/idl-meta.gram 
		Had to change a few things in the grammar: A few
		reserved words were used in the idlcfl.bet (div, mod,
		...), and a couple of places, the same nonterminal was
		used twice on a right-side, resulting in multiple
		defined names. Added tags in these cases.

		Known problems: One-line comments starting with //
		cannot be parsed.

		Current file structure:

		     bidl.bet			main program (PROGRAM SLOT)
		     control.bet		argument parsing, file
						opening etc.
		     idlsematt.bet		semantic level -
						currently identical to
						context free level
		     outfile.bet		encapsulation of
						output file. Should
						could model both a
						.bet and an AST file
		     translate.bet		Traversal of asts with
						translation to BETA
		     private/
		       betaoutfilebody.bet	body file for .bet
						file production

		Currently the division between .ast and .bet file
		production is not done correctly. The first version
		will be coded for .bet file production only - should
		be cleaned up later!

		Also translate.bet will quicly become too
		large. Should be fragmented.
	
PA: 10/11/97:	Fixed problem with one-line comments:
		Parsed had to be initialized with EOLasComEnd
		furtherbound to be true.
		Work on do_interface_header.
