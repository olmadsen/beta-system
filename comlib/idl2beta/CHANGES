PA: 7/11/97:	Created initial verion based on runtime-system meta
		generator, and using grammar
		  ~beta/r4.1/grammars/idl/v2.0/idl-meta.gram 
		Had to change a few things in the grammar: A few
		reserved words were used in the idlcfl.bet (div, mod,
		...), and a couple of places, the same nonterminal was
		used twice on a right-side, resulting in multiple
		defined names. Added tags in these cases.

		Known problems: One-line comments starting with //
		cannot be parsed.

		Current file structure:

		     bidl.bet			main program (PROGRAM SLOT)
		     control.bet		argument parsing, file
						opening etc.
		     idlsematt.bet		semantic level -
						currently identical to
						context free level
		     outfile.bet		encapsulation of
						output file. Should
						could model both a
						.bet and an AST file
		     translate.bet		Traversal of asts with
						translation to BETA
		     private/
		       betaoutfilebody.bet	body file for .bet
						file production

		Currently the division between .ast and .bet file
		production is not done correctly. The first version
		will be coded for .bet file production only - should
		be cleaned up later!

		Also translate.bet will quicly become too
		large. Should be fragmented.
	
PA: 10/11/97:	Fixed problem with one-line comments:
		Parsed had to be initialized with EOLasComEnd
		furtherbound to be true.
		Work on do_interface_header.
		And managed to get comments from the IDL files
		propagated into the generated .bet files.

		Identified problems:
		1. Leading zeros in UUID's seems to be missing in the
		   IDL-asts.
		   Can be fixed by collection the digits in an integer
		   (16 based), and printing them out using puxhex.
		   (NOTICE: puthex in r4.1 does not work on little
		   endian!)
		   
		2. The idl-grammar specifies that a list of
		   names may be specified for inheritance in the
		   header. This means multiple inheritance!
		   I do not know if this occurs in actual IDL files,
		   but we may run into a problem here later.
		   

		3. During parsing of an IDL file, I get the message
		     grammarTable.meta is NONE
		   This does not seem to influence behaviour, but it
		   worries me a little!

PA: 11/11/97:   Fixed do_inheritance_spec.
		Will stop program, if multiple inheritance is used.
		Added support for 'bidl *.idl' in control.bet.
		Fixed UUID decoding: Using Const.GetText instead of
		Const.GetValue fixed the problem.

PA: 13/11/97:   Moved some more stuff down into betaoutfilebody,
		mainly because beta-code in strings confuse beta-mode
		(in emacs) a lot! Having these bits of code in small
		fragments help a lot.
		Fixed most remaining parts of do_interface_header, and
		started on do_interface_body.
		Got to the parameters and exit types.

PA: 17/11/97:	A lot of work on parameters and return types.
		Now objidl.idl can be generated into an almost
		complete BETA interface.
		A few parameter types are missing, but the most
		significan remaining parts (judged from objidl alone)
		are handling of typedefs and import.
		Currently #ifdef's are parsed up to become comments.
		And there are typically #ifdefs around typedefs and
		imports, so we will have to figure out a solution
		here.

PA: 18/11/97:	Added const_exp.bet, which translates category
		const_exp (f...ing 200 lines of code for this - could
		be almost automatically generated by MPS (:-().
		This is used in size_is attributes.
		Changed do_declarator, so that it can be used by 
		do_length_is too.
