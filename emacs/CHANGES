June 12, 1996: Jorgen Lindskov Knudsen

Corrected bug in beta-hilit19.el making hilit of repetitions look 'funny'.

Integrated beta-fast-indent by Peter von der Ahe.  This is done by
adding a new function:
	beta-indent-buffer
which indents using the fast-indent method by pater von der Ahe.

Added beta-fast-indent.el to CVS

Added beta-font-lock.el to CVS.  This file is created by Erik Ernst,
and implements font-lock hilite functionality.

Added make-regexp.el to CVS.  This file is supplied by Erik Ernst, and
is a support library for beta-font-lock.el.
