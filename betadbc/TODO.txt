TODO for BDBC
-------------

(/) make full support for SQL types. (Date still not really considered)

(/) test in "real life setting"

( ) make support for prepared statements

( ) make support for stored procedures

( ) better support for metadata

( ) enable dynamic creation and deletion of data sources for applications 
    (This can turn out to be quite hard since parameters apparently are 
     driver dependent...)

( ) better handling of cursors

( ) implementation on UNIX platform

( ) a better exception handling mechanism




Minors
------

- how does one discover (in the easiest way) which ODBC version is 
supported by given driver? To be used if henv is to be allocated via
SLQAllocHandle.
