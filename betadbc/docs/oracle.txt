*** SUPPORTED DATA TYPES

Oracle doesn't support

       BOOLEAN (!)

(and many other nice data types :-( )

Oracle has a very strange default date format

       '30-NOV-1974'

no literal time can be expresses!!!

Problems with current (OpenLink) ODBC driver:
---------------------------------------------
- Bug: SQL_FETCH_{LAST,FIRST) only sets current result if SQL_FETCH_NEXT has been used 
  previously in SQLExtendedFetch
- INTEGER, NUMBER data types in columns give SQL_UNKNOWN_TYPE when asking for type...
- cursor name cannot be set/get !?
