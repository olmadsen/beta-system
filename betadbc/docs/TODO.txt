DirectSQLStatement
	(x) Fragment out set/getAsText on declareVars
	(x) Implement direcSQLStatement.setByName

resultSet/cursor
	(x) Rename to "cursor"
	(x) Implement scan

documentation
	( ) Update comments
	( ) Rewrite intro document
	( ) Recheck sample implementations

test
	( ) Test of cursor
		- positioned update does not work!
		- Access: bits are apparently always not nullable
			  "NOT NULL" does not seem to have any effect when
			  calling SQLDescribeCol
	( ) Probably: Move r5.0/betaunit/ to r5.0/betadbc/test/betaunit/

=========================================================================
To-do list for BetaDBC
=========================================================================

Majors
------

- implement additions to the current library
- factor out ODBC specific code (to prepare for Oracle CLI)

Minors
------

- currently, the ODBC cursor library is used (for insensitivity, positioned update,
scrollable cursors). This should not be so if the used driver has the capabilities
of the cursor library
- how does one discover (in the easiest way) which ODBC version is 
supported by given driver? To be used if henv is to be allocated via
SLQAllocHandle.

- What if a statement is executed, its resultSet scanned, minutes goes
by and the statement is used again? Should there be a close on a
resultSet & should resultSets only be initialised if data in them a accessed?
(The latter does not seem to have a large performance impact?)

- BDBCException may cut of extraordinarily long error msgs
(x) Remove artificial upper bounds on text strings (ConnectionPrivate.MAX_COL_TXT)

- check guesses made in using SQLGetColAttribute somehow...

- "type checking" of text pattern usage

- does SQLFreeStmt + SQL_DROP or SQL_CLOSE correspond to SQLFreeHandle
(SQL_HANDLE_STMT,...)?

=========================================================================
Old To-do list for BetaDBC
=========================================================================

(x) make full support for SQL types. (Date still not really considered)

(x) test in "real life setting"

( ) make support for prepared statements

( ) make support for stored procedures

( ) better support for metadata

( ) enable dynamic creation and deletion of data sources for applications 
    (This can turn out to be quite hard since parameters apparently are 
     driver dependent...)

(x) implementation on UNIX platform

( ) a better exception handling mechanism



Majors
------

- we have to consider how variations in underlying db technology can be handled along two dimensions
	- different versions of e.g. odbc
	- different connectivity strategies: cli, odbc, drda, ole db, ...

Minors
------

- check guesses made in using SQLGetColAttribute somehow...

- test transactions...

- separate versions of odbc in SQL.bet, SQLEXT.bet

- does SQLFreeStmt + SQL_DROP or SQL_CLOSE correspond to SQLFreeHandle
(SQL_HANDLE_STMT,...)?

Even Older TODO
=========================================


TODO for BDBC
----------------

(/) make full support for SQL types. (Date still not really considered)

(/) test in "real life setting"

( ) make support for prepared statements

( ) make support for stored procedures

( ) better support for metadata

( ) enable dynamic creation and deletion of data sources for applications 
    (This can turn out to be quite hard since parameters apparently are 
     driver dependent...)

( ) better handling of cursors

( ) implementation on UNIX platform

( ) a better exception handling mechanism



Majors

Porting to Unix platform:

- We need
	- a working ODBC-driver
	- a working ODBC-manager
	- probably an implementation of BetaDBC for ODBC v2.0
- We have	
	- a freeware Unix DB (postgreSQL) without working
driver,manager
	- BetaDBC for winnt, ODBC v3.0 (doesn't seem to be a big
problem though --- see 'usedfunction.txt'

- So what do we do
	( ) Get a working ODBC-driver
	( ) Get a working ODBC-manager
	( ) Test these with simple C-programs...
	( ) Make an ODBC v2.0 BetaDBC on winnt 
	( ) Restructure module structure of BetaDBC:

		currently

			bdbc

			bdbcbody		(MDBODY)

		bdbcntibody	bdbcunixbody	(almost identical)

	sql			sql		(has LINKOPT)
sqltypes		sqltypes
sqlext			sqlext

		we want something like

			bdbc

			bdbcbody		(using basic ops)

		odbcv2		odbcv3		(implementing basic ops)

		winntdb		postgresql ... (with LINKOPTs)
