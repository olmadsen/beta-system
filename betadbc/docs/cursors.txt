Cursors
=======
BetaDBC aims to support 5 different kinds of cursors orthogonally

	1. normal, forward-only cursors, as in

		EXEC SQL DECLARE myCursor FOR
			 SELECT * FROM myTable;

		EXEC SQL OPEN myCursor;

		EXEC SQL FETCH FROM execCursor INTO :myVariable;

		EXEC SQL CLOSE myCursor;

	2. modification by cursor, as in

		...

		EXEC SQL DELETE FROM myTable
			 WHERE CURRENT OF myCursor;

		EXEC SQL UPDATE myTable
			 SET ...
			 WHERE CURRENT OF myCursor;


	3. sensitive/insensitive cursors, as in

		EXEC SQL DECLARE myCursor INSENSITIVE CURSOR FOR
			 ...

	4. read-only cursors, as in

		EXEC SQL DECLARE myCursor FOR READ ONLY
			 ...

	5. scrolling cursors, as in

		EXEC SQL DECLARE myCursor SCROLL CURSOR FOR
			 ...

Cursors and ODBC
================
Cursors are accessed through "result sets" in ODBC. Unfortunately, a result set has a different model of cursors than does SQL-92. Another major problem is testing: Few drivers support cursors in full generality. Therefore, the ODBC Cursor Library, which simulates cursors, is currently used at all times!

	Ad 1. Poses no problems. A plain result set just has a plain cursor.
	Ad 2. Updateable cursors have to be created by an SQL statement with " FOR UPDATE OF [tuple names]" 	      postfixed. This has to be simulated.
	      Updating statements can be as in SQL.
	Ad 3. Sensitivity can be directly set on cursors. This has effect on other properties of the cursor, 	          	      such as scrollability, though:
		SQLSetStmtAttr with SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SENSITIVITY to SQL_INSENSITIVE/SQL_SENSITIVE
	Ad 4. Read-only is default if " FOR UPDATE OF [tuple names]" is not postfixed to a statement 
	Ad 5. Scrollability can be set directly using:
		SQLSetStmtAttr with SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SCROLLABLE to SQL_SCROLLABLE
	      However, ODBC has 4 types of scrollable cursors
		static
		dynamic
		keyset-driven
		mixed
	      with different kinds of sensitivity to e.g. concurrent updates that all may be chosen by a driver. 	      
approximated...
	      Well, this would probably be right if a driver supported cursors? However, the ODBC Cursor Library doesn't (grrr) support this! 
	      Well (again), you have to bind columns in order to use SQLFetchScroll & the ODBC Cursor Library :-( On for simulation...
