Tue Jan 28 12:04:43 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed the following filenames:

    valhalla_application_interface.bet application_interface.bet
    processcommmdbody_default.bet      proccommmdbody_default.bet
    processcommmdbody_linux.bet        proccommmdbody_linux.bet
    processcommmdbody_sun4s.bet        proccommmdbody_sun4s.bet

Thu Jan 23 23:03:04 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Removed automatic display of the command line editor on startup of
debuggee.  Instead it is only popped up when a new debuggee is
invoked.

Thu Jan  9 23:47:06 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Inserted tests in utilitiesbody.bet such that it could outlive changes
made to fragments, which debugging.

Wed Dec 11 12:34:58 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Added code to scanExtent before setting up a new debuggee.  This
scanExtent checks, that no source-files have been changed since the
compilation of the executable to be debugged.  Often this previously
gave rise to errors.

Mon Nov 11 08:38:37 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Updated to use the different correction versions of mps,
sourcebrowser, etc. (i.e. all the vx.y.1 versions).


Fri Nov  8 14:41:29 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Added further bindings of commError, stepFailure and breakFailure to
GUIprocess in GUIprocess.bet to make Valhalla behave more elegantly in
the case of these errors.

Changed setBreak in breakpointOperations.bet such that it ignores
breakpoints with indextonode errors, and ignores fg's that have been
modified.

Corrected flush in buffered_sockio.bet such that it does not crack if
the connection is broken.

Corrected debuggee.processComm.wait in private/valhallabody.bet such
that Valhalla outlives a Connection Broken situation (usually it's
because the user have killed the debuggee).

Thu Nov  7 13:17:14 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------
Changed in private/steppingbody.bet to correct QUA error when stepping
into a static item/component which is defined by a SLOT.  Changes made
in getObjectDesc.

Corrected findNearestLabel in private/steppingbody.bet such that it
did not result in index error when the executable is stripped.

Corrected init in private/dbmanagerbody.bet such that the debugger can
work even when there are no write access to the directory where the
..dbc file is supposed to be saved (the debugger just don't save in
this case).

Corrected binGetBytes in buffered_sockio.bet such that it should
report connBrokenError faults more gracefully that right now.
