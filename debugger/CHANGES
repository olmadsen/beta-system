Changes valhalla such that it is possible to say 'OK to All' when ..db
files are missing.

Fri Apr 18 13:49:37 METDST 1997 / jlk
-------------------------------------

Added stackbrowser functionality as a supplement to the current stack viewer.

This stackbrowser is not final, since there is a need for more
elaborate functionality to make the stackbrowser a true
manifestication of the stack.  However, the current version is a good
first shot at a true stackbrowser.

The advanced (lacking) functionality is, that whenever code and
objects needs to be shown, there needs to be implemented a test for,
whether this code/object is on (one of) the stack(s).  And if so, the
code/object should be shown in that particular stackbrowser (now it
will be shown in a separate window).

----------------------------------

1) Made sure, that all output (error messages) are shown in dialog
boxes, and not just written on screen.  All these messages are
converted into the new exception otherError in processInterface.

2) changed the strategy for testing for source code modifications
since last linking of the executable from using scanning the
dependency graph (slow) to using the file info in the executable by
using the debugger function scanObjectFileInfo.

3) removed valhallaMachineName, and now uses betaenv.machine_type instead.

4) Uses DBmanager operation 'slotNameToGroups' to find the fragment
group defining the program-fragment.  This implies, that Valhalla now
can find the source code, even when the executable have been remaned
and moved in the file structure.

Wed Feb 26 11:07:49 MET 1997 / datpete
--------------------------------------

1) Fixed error in betasematt in betaast/v5.1: The
   change made in index.bet for originoff was not made in
   betasematt. 
   Now objectviews also work correct in linux valhalla.

2) Introduced use of BUILD instead of MAKE in valhalla code.

3) Reintroduced pwrite for sgi - the libraryversion does not seem to work
   for breakpoint setting.

Wed Feb 19 15:26:58 MET 1997 / datpete
--------------------------------------

Fixed stupid bug in private/binarystreambody:
rep.R's initial range is now 2 instead of 1.
This prevents BinaryStreamFragRestore from destroying
NEXT object in heap, since it starts by reading 2 longs
without range check.

This error was not visible on RISC's since the
8-byte alignment on objects on all these platforms ensures,
that there is actually room for the 2 longs, even though 
the initial range was only 1!

Linux valhalla now sems to work!

Tue Jan 28 12:04:43 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed the following filenames:

    valhalla_application_interface.bet application_interface.bet
    processcommmdbody_default.bet      proccommmdbody_default.bet
    processcommmdbody_linux.bet        proccommmdbody_linux.bet
    processcommmdbody_sun4s.bet        proccommmdbody_sun4s.bet

Thu Jan 23 23:03:04 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Removed automatic display of the command line editor on startup of
debuggee.  Instead it is only popped up when a new debuggee is
invoked.

Thu Jan  9 23:47:06 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Inserted tests in utilitiesbody.bet such that it could outlive changes
made to fragments, which debugging.

Wed Dec 11 12:34:58 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Added code to scanExtent before setting up a new debuggee.  This
scanExtent checks, that no source-files have been changed since the
compilation of the executable to be debugged.  Often this previously
gave rise to errors.

Mon Nov 11 08:38:37 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Updated to use the different correction versions of mps,
sourcebrowser, etc. (i.e. all the vx.y.1 versions).


Fri Nov  8 14:41:29 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Added further bindings of commError, stepFailure and breakFailure to
GUIprocess in GUIprocess.bet to make Valhalla behave more elegantly in
the case of these errors.

Changed setBreak in breakpointOperations.bet such that it ignores
breakpoints with indextonode errors, and ignores fg's that have been
modified.

Corrected flush in buffered_sockio.bet such that it does not crack if
the connection is broken.

Corrected debuggee.processComm.wait in private/valhallabody.bet such
that Valhalla outlives a Connection Broken situation (usually it's
because the user have killed the debuggee).

Thu Nov  7 13:17:14 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------
Changed in private/steppingbody.bet to correct QUA error when stepping
into a static item/component which is defined by a SLOT.  Changes made
in getObjectDesc.

Corrected findNearestLabel in private/steppingbody.bet such that it
did not result in index error when the executable is stripped.

Corrected init in private/dbmanagerbody.bet such that the debugger can
work even when there are no write access to the directory where the
..dbc file is supposed to be saved (the debugger just don't save in
this case).

Corrected binGetBytes in buffered_sockio.bet such that it should
report connBrokenError faults more gracefully that right now.
