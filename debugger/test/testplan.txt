                                  Valhalla
                           Mjolner System Debugger
                          Draft pointwise testplan.

Try out the following:
* Test the internal browsing facilities
* Try extern sourcebrowsing (sif). Ensure that the open project is opened in
sif. Open-close a couple of times.
* Try to open another project. This should be opened in sif too.
* Try "go until mark" (find first statement)
* Try "go", should execute program to the end.
* Rerun (should close all stack & object windows )
* Try "Set breakpoint" + "go"
* Try "Set Tracepoint" + "go"
* Ensure that the breakpointlist in the Menu is correct.
* Set some breakpoint, save breakpoints. Leave Valhalla. Restart Valhalla
and try to load the breakpoints.
* Leave valhalla. Touch the testprogram and recompile. Start Valhalla and
try to load the breakpoints. This should result in a error msg.
* Set some breakpoints, shift to sif, check the breakpoints. Set some in
sif, and check them in valhalla.
* Set som breakpoints on desc.-slots and do-parts.
* Try the three buttons: Object, Code,Stack. Browse. Try out the
right-button menu.
* Try the stackbrowser in the windows menu.
* Edit-Menu: Try environment and commandline param.
* Use the TST/tstdump programs to ensure that Valhalla finds all runtime
errors correct, with correct error messages.
