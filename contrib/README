This directory contains various utilities, which are not supported as part of
the standard Mj|lner BETA System distribution.  The utilities are either
experimental versions of facilities, which might be included in future releases
of the Mj|lner BETA System, or they are merely contributions from externel
sources.

Currently, the directory contains:

	changed		which is a change propagation system for e.g. user
			interface consistencies
	futures		which is an implementation of future values to be used
			in a concurrent system
	gleipner	which is an experimental implementation of a constraint
			system based on the SkyBlue constraint solver
	invariant	which is an experimental implementation of an invariant
			system for BETA
	tcs		which is an experimental implementation of an image
			processing library for BETA
	rbeta		contains BETA code for simulating intersection, union,
			and unification combinators from logic programming.
	threads		contains the BETA source code for the "Threads" news
			index generator (http://www.daimi.aau.dk/~beta/News)

Each directory contains version subdirectories (e.g. v1.0 and v1.1).  These
versions mirrors the development history of these utilities, or versions for
specific MBS releases.  The highest version conforms to the latest MBS release.

Please observe, that these libraries are UNSUPPORTED, and may contain errors.
