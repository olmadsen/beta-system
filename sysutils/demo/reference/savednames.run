Creating the following disk entries: 
	directory ~/bar/
	link      ~/foo1 -> ~/bar
	link      ~/foo2 -> ~/bar
	file      ~/bar/foo

Converting paths:
	'~/foo1/foo' is converted to ${HOME}/foo1/foo
	'~/bar/foo'  is converted to ${HOME}/foo1/foo
	'~/foo2/foo' is converted to ${HOME}/foo1/foo

Cleaning up.
