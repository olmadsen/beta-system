VERSION 1.6, Release 4.1.
=========================

The following changes were introduced:

Patthandler now preserves case of filenames on macintosh and windows.

VERSION 1.5 in Release 4.0.2
=============

The following changes were introduced:

private/objinterfacebody: corrected error in ObjectToComponent.
endian:  Added BSD style conversion patterns. (ntohl and friends)
RepetitionObject:  Added support for big-endian output on any endian.
Objinterface:  Added ScanSimples.

VERSION 1.5 up to release 4.0.1
=============

With v1.5 the following changes were introduced:

objinterface.bet:

printObject now works, when obj[] is NONE (printing 'NONE').


Pathhandler.bet:

Added patterns 

  DirectoryChar
  CurrentDirectory
  ScanSearchPath

in LIB: attributes outside the pathhandler pattern.
That is, these patterns may be used without having
an *instance* of pathhandler.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The implementation of pathhandler
has been restructured a lot in v1.5. Primarily a 
pathhandlerbody file has been added, and most fragments
have been abstracted into machine independant implementations
in this file. One fragment, however, still exists in
a version for each machine type, namely ConvertFilePathBody.
Much of the functionality in this slot are identical on
all platforms, but it still remains to do the necessary
abstractions to turn it into a machine independant fragment.

objinterface.bet:
=================

Changed group_header from

group_header: data
  (# self: ^group_header;
     protoTableAdr: @Integer;
     next: ^group_header;
     code_start: @Integer;
     code_end: @Integer;
  #);

to

group_header: data
  (# data_start: ^group_header;
     protoTableAdr: @Integer;
     data_end: ^group_header;
     code_start: @Integer;
     code_end: @Integer;
     groupNameAddr: @integer;
     unique_group_id_hash: @Integer;
     unique_group_id_modtime: @Integer;
     ptr: @Integer
  #);

according to betarun/v2.9.

Added constant definitions for DynItemRepPTValue and DynCompRepPTValue.

VERSION 1.4
=============
With v1.4 the following changes were introduced:

All files:
==========

1) INCLUDE fragments have been replaced by INCLUDE properties.

2) Fragment *group* syntax ( [[ and ]] ) has been removed

time.bet:
============

This was added in this release. Includes the "formattime" attribute
that was previously defined in file.bet in basiclib.

Added patterns CpuTime, which return number of milliseconds since the
first call of it, and preciseTime, which returns the system time in
milliseconds, as opposed to the systemTime patterns which returns the
system time in seconds.

objinterface.bet:
=================

0) Moved from ~beta/sysutils/v1.4
1) Most patterns now have doparts.
2) Prototype.formId renamed to ProtoType.groupId (as this is actually what
   it is) and reimplemented to involve a search as the groupId information 
   is no longer directly available in the prototype.
3) Prototype.astIndex and Prototype.formIndex added.
4) getPrototype changed to exit the address of the prototype instead of a
   reference to a prototype object. This is done for efficiency reasons as
   this pattern is used heavily in the ObjectSerializer.
5) extGetCstring and assignRef externals added.


cstring.bet:
============

Moved from ~beta/basiclib/v1.4.

endian.bet:
===========

New file. Contains patterns to use for testing whether the host machine
is little- or big-endian.

dpc.bet:
=======

New file. Used to circumvent a limitation in the BETA runtime system,
when using systemenv.


VERSION 1.5
=========================================================================

In version 1.5 the followiung changes were introduced:

objinterface.bet
================

The size attribute of a prototype is the size in longs. This was
clarified in the comments.
