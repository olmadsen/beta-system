PathHandler:
(*
 *  This pattern converts the Mjolner path notation to and from full native paths.
 *
 *  The following abbreviations are handled:
 *
 *      ~    is expanded into the home directory of the user
 *      ~foo is expanded into the home directory of foo
 *      .    is interpreted relatively to another path 
 *           (see ConvertFilePath below)
 *      ..   is interpreted relatively to another path 
 *           (see ConvertFilePath below)
 * 
 *      Environment variables like $(HOME) are expanded within paths.
 *
 *  PathHandler examines the environment variable
 *      
 *      BETALIB. If set, this determines the home directory of the Mjolner 
 *               BETA system. 
 * 
 *      The value of BETALIB may, but need not, be terminated by '/'.

      * directory of the user, and if it starts with ~foo, this is expanded

   * Notice that if the file itself is a link to another file, these two

   * Notice also that in this special pathhandler, it is significant whether
