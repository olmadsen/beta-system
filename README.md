In addition it contains **The qBeta System,** which consists of a compiler for qbeta, a library of qBeta objects and an SDE for qBeta.

The MJølner Beta System was originally developed as part of the Nordic Mjølner Project and afterwards by Mjølner Informatics LtD. and Aarhs University.  The following people took part in the development, Peter Andersen, Lars Bak, Jørgen Lindskov Knudsen, Ole Lehrmann Madsen, Claus Nørgard, Elmer Sandvad, +++ to be completed.
