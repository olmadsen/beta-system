Generation BOBSGEN tools on Windows NT and Windows 95:
======================================================


1-Creating the C files under UNIX
*********************************

a) Go to some Unix system that has p2c installed and correctly
   compiled. Run

	p2c -a exbobs.p
		(or just "make", which automates some tedious setup jobs,
		 ignored in the above cmd.)

   to obtain exbobs.c, the -a option generates ANSI C code instead of old
   Kernigham & Ritchie C code (i.e. generates function prototypes and
   they are important to catch up errors, specially in PCs, I noticed
   that the LINUXbobsgen.c, SUN4bobsgen.c were generated without using
   the -a option!!)

b) transfer the files exbobs.c, p2clib.c, p2c.h to the target Windows
   machine. The p2clib.c implements the library, p2c.h is the include
   file with preprocessor stuff and declarations. They are fixed, meaning
   you will always use the same files no matter what program you are
   converting to C. They are at

	fraxinus: ~beta/bobsgen/v1.6/exbobs.c
	fraxinus: ~beta/bobsgen/p2c/v1.20/src/p2c.h
	fraxinus: ~beta/bobsgen/p2c/v1.20/src/p2clib.c


2- Compiling under Windows
**************************

a) using e.g. the Microsoft C compiler compile the code. You might get
   into a problem because in line 80 of exbobs.c you have

	#include <p2c/p2c.h>

   changing this to 

	#include "p2c.h"

   (NOTICE the QUOTES!!) will make compilation easier because now you can
   put the 3 files together, otherwise you have to figure out where are
   the standard include files, add the p2c dir there and put the p2c.h
   file in that subdir

b) copy the binary to the correct place, e.g. under tuborg

	copy exbobs.exe e:\beta\bobsgen\v1.5\nti\ms\NTIexbobs.exe
