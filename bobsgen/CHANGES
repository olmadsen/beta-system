Error corrected in procedures nontwrit and writenont
----------------------------------------------------

	A explicit test for the nonterminal with internal value 'nontstart'
	has been inserted. In this case the string 'GoalSymbol' is written.
	Apperently the pointer nontermp is not defined for this value.

	The procedures makes a test for nonterminal value zero. This
	test seems to be superflous or a mistake since a nonterminal
	never can have the value zero, but is always in the range
	[nontstart,nontslut]. The zero test has, however, not been removed.

OLM, 17.8.95

Error corrected in procedure lookahead:trans
--------------------------------------------

	Lookahead computation was not computed correctly when
	option 59 was used; see comment in corrected procedure.
