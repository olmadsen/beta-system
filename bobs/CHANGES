OLM: 1/1/97:	Minor fix in lex:skipToString to position error mark
		at last char in << or (* when eos met before termination

OLM: 18/6/97:	Added operation ProdSyWithNonZeroLabelNo to fix listZero
		problem!

OLM: 28/7/98: 	Minor fix in lex:initialize:

			minInt -> newSymb

		to handle problem with parsing empty fragment forms.

		Fixed loop in computed remote: FEJL/row

OLM: 29/11/98:	Changed lex.bet to allow splitting a STRING into
		units of the form:
		
		   '....'   '....'   '.....'

		Such a unit is still handled as one STRING lexem;
		a zero character is inserted to indicate the position
		where the string may be split by a pretty printer.

OLM: 18/12/98:	A boolean 'stringSplit' must be set in bobs:init 
		to enable OLM:29/12/98


OLM: 29/11/00:	In private/lex::NextCh, a zero-character is converted to
		ascii.fs which in most cases will result in a parse error.
