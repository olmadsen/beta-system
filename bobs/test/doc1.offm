     <Q> ... the pigs had to expend enormous labour every day upon mysterious
       things called files, reports, minutes and  memorand. These things were
       large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing,
       and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace ...
	</Q>
       . Do you  think SGML would have helped the pigs?
       I dont '<P> know if it''s ok </P>', he said!
