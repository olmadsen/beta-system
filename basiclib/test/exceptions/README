These files test dynamic exceptions in various situations.

See current status for the different platforms in the
section named "STATUS:" below.


OVERVIEW:
=========

tstexcept01: RefNoneErr
tstexcept02: RefNoneErr
tstexcept03: RefNoneErr
tstexcept04: RefNoneErr
tstexcept05: RefNoneErr
tstexcept06: RefNoneErr
tstexcept07: RepRangeErr
tstexcept08: RepHighRangeErr
	   NOTE08: It is a RepHighRangeErr since the runtime check is:
		     if (low<LowBorder) then RepLowRangeErr
		     if (high>Highorder) then RepHighRangeErr
		   And low (2) is not less than LowBorder (1).
		   This semantics has been requested since people want to
		   be able to express an empty slice using low>high.
tstexcept09: RefNoneErr with external activation record on stack.
           NOTE09: Only works with swith 13 at the moment
 
tstexcept10: RecursiveAttachErr
tstexcept11: RecursiveAttachErr
tstexcept12: RefNoneErr allocating a
tstexcept13: RefNoneErr allocating b
tstexcept14: RefNoneErr allocating y
tstexcept15: CompTerminatedErr
tstexcept16: ZeroDivErr or ArithExceptErr
tstexcept17: QuaErr - try both with and without BETART=QuaCont.
           NOTE17: Does not run exception handler with QuaCont

tstexcept18: SegmentationErr - with callback frame on stack
           NOTE18: Only works with switch 13 at the moment

tstexcept19: RefNoneErr in --program--
tstexcept20: CTextPoolErr (uses betaenv) 
           NOTE20: Now obsolete

tstexcept21: InterruptErr (UNIX betarun.debug only)
           NOTE21: Doesn't seem to catch interrupt (skipped)

tstexcept22: FpZeroDivErr
tstexcept23: StackErr
           NOTE23: Segmentation Fault Core Dumped (skipped)

tstexcept24: RefNoneErr, ORIGIN is dopart object
tstexcept25: LeaveBasicCompErr
	   NOTE28: SGI: Not even caught: ExO causes a bus error!
		        Check is missing in NEWRUN/ExitObjects.c!!!!!
                   Exception is caugt, but a segmentation fault is
                        thrown at the end which is not caugt

tstexcept26: RefNoneErr, INNER P chain
tstexcept27: RepHighRangeErr for C parameter
tstexcept28: RefNoneErr in inlined exit part
tstexcept29: ArithExceptErr (integer overflow)
           NOTE29: Only overflows on sgi - no errors on others

tstexcept30: SegmentationErr outside beta - with callback frame on stack
           NOTE30: Does not work on intel

tstexcept31: SegmentationErr outside beta - with callback frame on stack
           NOTE31: Only works with swith 13
 
tstexcept32: SegmentationErr outside beta - with callback frame on stack
           NOTE32: Only works with swith 13

tstexcept33: SegmentationErr outside beta - with callback frame on stack
           NOTE33: Only works with switch 13

tstexcept34: FpZeroDivErr outside BETA (sgi only)
tstexcept35: Object.%break
tstexcept39: RepRangeErr for C parameter combined with complex exit part
