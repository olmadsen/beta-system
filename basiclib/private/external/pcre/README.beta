This is the standard PCRE distribution with a few minor differences
to let it build.  chartables.c is a run-time generated file in the
original.  Here it has been built on Linux and put in CVS.  config.h
is also a source file (in CVS) rather than being generated.  pcre.h
has been generated on Linux and is also in CVS.
