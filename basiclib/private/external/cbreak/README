   This is a sh-archive !

   Name:   my_getch.sh
   Version: 0.1
   Author: R. Vankemmel (vankemme@imec.be)

   This archive provides some routines for doing 
   unbuffered character input on UNIX systems. 
   It has been tested on BSD and SYSV based UNIX systems
   (see the INSTALL file). VAX-VMS systems use  Sytem Service
   routines for handling the input. 
   Furthermore extensions towards THINK-C 
   on MAC, 
   and Amiga DOS systems are provided but still not fully
   tested. 
   If you enhance the code, I'll be happy to receive your 
   modifications in order to include them (if appropriate) in
   further releases.

   The following files are in the archive:

     README     : this file

     COPYRIGHT  : the copyright notice
     INSTALL    : how to install and port this software
