   1) The package originated in a larger project which needed some
   basic on line menu system. As more people were interested in
   unbuffered input from the keyboard, the routines were 
   isolated from the project and archived.
   R. Vankemmel wrote it.

   2) V0.1 januari 12, 1994: R. Vankemmel : first PD release.

	   getkey() routine for VAX under VMS using the System Service
