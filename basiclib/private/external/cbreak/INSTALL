   -----------------------------------------------------------------

   1) General Notes:

   These routines have been tested and installed on the following
   platforms:
       Apollo DN4500 Domain OS SR10.3      (BSD)
       HP-Apollo 425 Domain OS SR10.3      (BSD)
       HP 9000   735 HP-UX  V9.0           (SYSV)
       Convex C2     ConvexOs              (BSD)
       SUN Sparc     SunOs                 (BSD)
       SUN Sparc     Solaris 2.3           (Solaris)
       DECstation 5000/120 RISC Ultrix 4.X (BSD)
       DECstation 3500 Alpha    OSF V1.3   (OSF)
       DECstation Alpha OpenVMS 6.1        (VMS)
       VAX 8X00 // VAX 6X00 OpenVMS 5.5    (VMS)
       VAX 780  Ultrix 4.X                 (BSD)

   The routines were already adapted towards the following platforms
   but are still untested:

       AMIGA               using sgtty lib
       MAC                 using THINK-C lib

   2) Compile:

   2.1) For the above platforms no problem should occur in compiling them as
        the system dependent settings are already done in the sysdefs.h header
        file.

   2.2) Edit the makefile: change the compiler entry CC towards your platform.
	Remember to ask for the ANSI C compiler. As long as vendors do not
	provide the ANSI-C compiler as the default compiler, you will need
	to edit the makefile as it mostly needs some extra machine dependent
	command line options for invoking the ANSI C compiler.

	Note: for the supported platforms so far, the needed flags are
	commented in the makefile.

	Note 2: on VAX-VMS systems use the make.com file.

   3) Platform port:

   If you decide to port the code to a not-yet-supported platform, then
   do the following:

   3.1) Look on your system for a ANSI C compiler and edit the makefile
	towards the necessary command line options.

   3.2) Edit the sysdefs.h header file.
	In this file the systems dependent settings are done. The most
	important things to set are the following:

	1) look up which flags are set by the C-preprocessor at compile time
	   which you can use to select the code to be included. 
	   Write these flags down in the top part of the sysdefs.h file.
	   See this file for the settings on the predefined platforms.
	   This/These flags can be used latter for switching between 
	   different platforms automatically.

	2) look if your system is SYSV or BSD based.
	   Add the appropriate define's in the sysdefs.h file.

	3) see if your system has termio (typically SYSV), sgtty (BSD)
	   or any other terminal control capabilities. 
	   Set in sysdefs.h the appropriate flags like HAS_TERMIOS or
	   HAS_SGTTY in order to check on the the source code to compile.

	4) if your system has such terminal control capabilities 
	   and ioctl() calls, then work is done here and you can compile
	   the code. 

	5) If your system does not have such terminal capabilities (e.g.
	   VAX-VMS, MAC) then you must provide a workaround based on your
	   knowledge of your system. As an example I provided a (SYSV-)
	   curses based workaround for VAX-VMS systems having the 
	   VMS_POSIX shell 
	   and a workaround on MAC using THINK-C library functions.
	   However, on VMS systems you can use also the System Service 
	   routines.

	   If you find and provide such a workaround for any other platform,
	   i'll be happy to get informed about it so that I can enhance
	   the code.

	6) In case you use this code and you port your code with this
	   routine to a platform missing any terminal control (does there
	   exist one ?), a fallback routine my_gets() is provided which
	   gets called by my_getch() automatically after setting the 
	   proper definitions in sysdefs.h

     4) Note:
     In case you modify/change/enhance the code, I will be happy to 
     hear about them and insert them into the released code.
