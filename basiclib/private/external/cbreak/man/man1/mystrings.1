mystrings \- some small string handling routines.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp 1
.nf

 int trim(char s[])

 int skip(char s[])

 void reverse(char s[])

 void itoa(int n, char s[])

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
These routines provide simple string handling:
.sp1 
.in +3n
.ti -3n
trim() takes a string and removes trailing blanks, tabs and
newlines from the string. After processing, the string is delimited
by '\0'. The return value of trim() is the index in the character array
pointing to the last character after processing and equals the length 
of the processed string.
.sp 1
.ti -3n
skip() : the same as trim() but now for leading blanks and tabs.
The return value of skip() points to the first non-blank or non-tab
character in the string. Note that the string s[] is NOT modified.
.sp 1
.ti -3n
reverse() : reverse a string s in place.
.sp 1
.ti -3n
itoa() : convert a integer number to characters in the string s.
.sp 1
.in -3n
.SH "\fINOTE\fR"
.sp 1
The itoa() function is NOT ANSI C and only provided here as a
portability routine for foreign programs. For new routines use
the standard ANSI C sprintf() functionality for converting integers
to strings.
.SH "\fIUSAGE\fR"
This routine does NOT allocate any memory for storing the strings.
The application programmer must provide them.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
See the description of the routines.
.SH ERRORS
Unknown.
