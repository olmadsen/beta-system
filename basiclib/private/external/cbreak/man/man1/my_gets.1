.SH NAME
my_gets \- get string routine with ^D detection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp 1
.nf

 char *my_gets(char *buffer, int *begin)

.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
my_gets() has the same functionality as gets()
but it checks when gets() returns a NULL pointer.
This is mainly because an EOF was read. In case
gets() is used in a loop, this may cause endless 
loops because stdin is closed when a ^D at input 
was given. my_gets() then reopens stdin so that
input reading may continue.

my_gets() skips also leading blanks and tabs.
It returns the position in the buffer of the 
first relevant char.
.SH "\fIUSAGE\fR"
This routine does NOT allocate any memory for storing the strings.
The application programmer must provide them.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH "PARAMETERS-RETURN VALUE"

                              buffer[]
                   on CR/LF:  NULL pointer;
