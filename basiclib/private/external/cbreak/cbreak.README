Submitted-by: vankemme@imec.be (Rudi Vankemmel)
Posting-number: Volume 46, Issue 13
Archive-name: cbreak/part01
Environment: BSD, SYSV, HP-UX, SUNOS, ULTRIX, VMS, OSF, SOLARIS, ANSI-C, VAXC

This archive provides some routines for doing unbuffered character 
input on UNIX systems and VMS based systems (A FAQ !!!).

Now V0.3 is released; it has been ported to the following systems

       - VAX - OpenVMS 5.5
       - DEC Alpha OpenVMS 6.1
       - DEC Alpha OSF V1.3
       - SUN Sparc Solaris 2.3

Generally porting to other BSD and SYSV based UNIX flavors which were
not yet supported in V0.2, should be quite easy (handles now termio,
sgtty and POSIX style tcgetattr).  Furthermore extensions for MAC (using 
THINK C), IBM, Sony, MIPS and Amiga DOS systems are provided but still 
not tested. If you enhance the code, I'll be happy to receive your 
modifications in order to include them (if appropriate) in further 
releases.

The archive is also available by anonymous ftp to imec.be in the 
directory /pub/asp/tcad/rvk/ . The following files are there:

       cbreak.sh   : the sh archive  (+- 65k, ascii)
       cbreak.TZ   : tarcompressed archive (+- 57k, binary mode)
       cbreak.tar.gz : gzip'ped and tar'ed archive (+- 36k, binary)

Enjoy,

    Rudi Vankemmel.
