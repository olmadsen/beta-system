(* This small program illustrates a way to invoke an external program
 * on UNIX without using the Process library.  The UNIX 'system' C
 * library function is used.  'system' takes a text string and
 * "forks" and executes it as a UNIX shell command.
 * 
 * In this program, 'system' is used to invoke the 'clear' command,
 * which will erase the contents of the screen terminal.  Notice, that
 * 'clear' should be in your search path, for this demo to work
 * (specificly notice, that on SGI, 'clear' is in /usr/bsd).
 * 
 * In general the Process library should be used for invoking external
 * programs, (works on all platforms).
