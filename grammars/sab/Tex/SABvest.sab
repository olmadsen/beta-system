<section>
<headerII>1.1		GENERAL</headerII>

<p>
The Contractor is responsible for the design and construction of all scaffolding and formwork and shall in due time prior to the construction make detailed drawings and calculations of the scaffolding and formwork. Drawings and calculations shall be sufficiently detailed to ensure that the proposed scaffolding and formwork have sufficient strength, rigidity and stability to meet all loads and combinations of loads occurring during the execution and that the foundation are adequate with regard to bearing capacity, stability and deformations.
</p>

<p>
The above-mentioned requirements shall also apply to the patented prefabricated types. These patented types shall in the following be designated "Scaffolding systems". The bearing capacity of the "Scaffolding systems " shall to the Employer_s Representative acceptance be documentarily proved either by calculations approved by an authority, a testing laboratory or the like (e.g. german type certificate or swedish permission for use) or by test loading carried out in a testing laboratory or the like.
</p>

<p>
Before foundation of any scaffolding the Contractor shall verify that he has obtained all data and information concerning the bearing capacity and deformation of the ground  and if so needed he must undertake supplementary exploratory work in the field.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the Contractor shall verify that the conditions, assumed for the design of the scaffolding, are correct and shall keep on file the recorded driving of scaffolding piles, if any.
</p>

<p>
No scaffolding work and formwork may be commenced prior to the availability of the comments made by the Employer's Representative to the Contractor's documentation and project material, and before the Contractor has incorporated the necessary corrections, if any.

<itemlist>
<itemstart>
Dead load:
</itemstart>

<shortitem>-  	Scaffolding and formwork.</shortitem>

<shortitem>- 	Hardened concrete including reinforcing steel:

</itemstart>
<shortitem>-  	Fresh concrete including reinforcing steel: 25 kN/m3.</shortitem>
</itemlist>

<p>
Form elements, bearers and other structural members directly supporting the formwork shall be designed to carry the weight of the concrete plus an additional load which allows for impact. Such additional load may normally be fixed at 30% of the weight of the concrete, however limited to a maximum of 3 kN/m2.
</p>

<p>
The lateral pressure exerted on the formwork by fresh concrete shall be determined with regard to the rate of casting, the consistency of the concrete, and the temperature of the concrete at the time of casting. The Contractor shall use properly documented calculation methods.
</p>

<itemlist>

<shortitem>-  	Wind load is according to DS 410.</shortitem>
<shortitem>- 	Horizontal mass load: In addition to any external horizontal load the scaffolding shall be designed to withstand a horizontal load acting in any direction, equal to 1% of the vertical load. If the combined horizontal loads are less than 2.5% of the vertical load a horizontal load of 2.5% shall be used.</shortitem>
</itemlist>
</subsubsection>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<headerIII>1.2.2	Design Basis</headerIII>

<p>
Scaffolding and formwork are included under normal safety class.
</p>

<p>
Scaffolding and formwork shall (ref. DS 409) be designed to withstand:
</p>

<p>
Load combination 1, application of the serviceability limit state regarding the requirements for vertical and lateral deflection etc., ref. 1.2.5 and 
</p>

<p>
Load combination 2, the ultimate strength situation. Combinations of the loads specified in clause 1.2.1 shall be examined, taking into consideration that a general live load may occur simultaneously with fresh concrete.
</p>

<p>
Timber structures shall be designed to withstand the combination of loads with the concrete calculated as variable (live) load (fresh concrete, K-load) and as dead load (hardened concrete, L + P load), ref. DS 413, appendix B.
</p>

<p>
	Load reduction factor    is equal to 1.0.
</p>

<p>
For the purpose of the structural analysis of the scaffolding and formwork the following applies:
</p>

<p>
Steel structures:
</p>

<p>
Normal material control.
</p>

<p>
Timber structures:
</p>

<p>
Moisture class U (according to Danish Standard)
</p>

<p>
Foundation:
</p>

<p>
Normal foundation class. The figure   , stated in DS 415, clause 5.2.2 is equal to l.0.
</p>

</subsection>


<subsection>
<headerIII>1.2.3	Scaffolding Systems</headerIII>

<p>
When using "Scaffolding Systems" for which the bearing capacity is documented by a valid type approval or permission for use from another country, the scaffolding will normally be accepted when the calculations are carried out in accordance with rules and laws of the country in question. However, as a minimum, the established characteristic loads in this specification including the horizontal load of 2.5% shall be applied.
</p>

<p>
Example: By using a German type approval, which indicates the allowable bearing capacity, such capacity shall be checked against the characteristic loads in this specification with due consideration to the stated conditions in DIN 4421, August, 82.
</p>

<p>
Whenever the bearing capacity of a "Scaffolding System" is being documented by testing, the characteristic bearing capacity shall be determined as described in DS 412, clause 8.6 Testing.
The partial coefficient m   shall be established as described in DS 412, clause 5.2, with due consideration to the relevant method of failure.
</p>

<p>
Example: Where failure occurs by deflection of a verticalmember the partial coefficient can typically be set to: 1.56 x 0.9 = 1.40.
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<headerIII>1.2.4	Tolerances and Deviations</headerIII>

<p>
The details, general arrangement, and erection of the formwork shall be such that the stipulated tolerances for permanent work are achieved. 
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<headerIII>1.2.5	Camber - Deformations</headerIII>

<p>
The vertical and lateral deflection of forms, bearers, planks and the like may not exceed 1/400 of the span of such structural members.
</p>

<p>
The vertical deflection of main girders supporting formwork shall be less than 1/200 of the span of such girders.
</p>

<p>
If the deflection exceeds 1/400 of the span, or if the span exceeds 6 m, the deflection shall be eliminated by giving the formwork a corresponding camber and/or elevating the formwork as a unit by means of wedges and/or packings. Camber to counteract the deformations of the finished construction will be indicated on the drawings.
</p>

<p>
The Contractor shall, to the satisfaction of the Employer's Representative, adjust the levels of scaffolding and formwork, and he shall provide formwork e.g. beams, slabs and the like, with suitable cambers in order to counteract any interim or permanent settlement.
</p>

<subsection>
<headerIII>1.4.2	Formwork</headerIII>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.1	Tightness and Design</headerIV>

<p>
The forms for the road bridge edge beams shall be constructed so that they are supported on the form for the cantilevered bridge deck
</p>

<p>
The formwork shall be sufficiently tight to prevent the formation of sandy patches due to leakage of cement and fine aggregates.
</p>

<p>
Forms with positions which are inaccessible or difficult to reach shall have temporary openings or slots with closely fitting, removable trap doors or panels from which the interior of the form may be inspected and through which the concrete may be placed and vibrated.
</p>

<p>
Such openings shall be located in consultation with the Employer's Representative and shall normally be confined to concealed surfaces of the concrete work. The closing of such temporary openings shall be planned so as to avoid any interruption of the casting procedure.
</p>

<p>
Sloping surfaces may need to be formed up. Such formwork shall be made up of removable panels of a length which makes it possible to place and vibrate the concrete, and screed off excess concrete without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
The tightness of vertical formwork shall be obtained by the use of tongued and grooved boards or in some other manner which is equally effective.
</p>

<p>
Boards for horizontal formwork need not be grooved-and-tongued, but shall have planed edges and efficient measures shall be adopted to prevent any leaks.
</p>

<p>
Joints in formboards shall be staggered and shall be distributed in a random fashion so as to avoid any noticeable concentration of joints in any area. In joints, the cut shall be perpendicular on the axis of the board and shall be carefully made so as to produce full contact between abutting ends.
</p>

<p>
Form panels shall be joined in a manner which will ensure complete tightness without preventing any unavoidable swelling of the form material to take place.
</p>

<p>
Joint in steel plates shall be planed so as to produce a uniform concrete surface without noticeable joints.
</p>

<p>
Visible vertical casting joints shall be made perfectly vertical by ensuring the formwork is vertical.
</p>

<p>
All edges shall, unless otherwise shown on the drawings, be bevelled by a triangular list with 20 mm sides.
</p>

<p>
For the superstructure all vertical and angled casting joints shall be covered with shuttering and, if necessary, openings for the reinforcement shall be prepared.
</p>


<p>
[*ul*]Specially for Climbing Form Shuttering[*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
The form shall be produced and erected most carefully. The form panels shall be joined in a manner which positively allows no relative movements whatsoever, and the forms shall be held absolutely firmly in position while the concrete is being cast. The formwork shall be constructed in a manner which makes it possible to loosen and remove the form panels without any damage whatsoever to the concrete surface.
</p>

<p>
The climbing form shall have devices which hold the cage of reinforcing bars securely in the correct position. The lengths of reinforcing bars projecting above the concrete shall, in particular, be supported laterally at suitable levels above the form (depending upon the length of the bars), so as to prevent any lateral movements or deflections of the bars due to any random forces (wind).
</p>

<p>
A sufficient amount of working platforms shall be provided to give convenient access for the erection of the formwork, fixing of reinforcing steel and casting of the concrete and for the removal of the forms and the inspection and repair of the concrete surfaces.
</p>

<p>
The means of access to the working platforms for workers and for the staff of the Contractor and the Employer's Representative shall be as convenient as possible, and the Contractor shall construct separate scaffolding with stairways or provide a lift or other suitable means for the purpose.
</p>


<p>
[*ul*]Specially for Slip Form Shuttering[*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
The height of the form and the level of casting shall be established with due consideration to the assumed concrete consistency, vibration method and sliding velocity.
</p>

<p>
Creepers and lift trestles shall be positioned in such a way and at such intervals that, with due consideration  to friction on the panels, workload and stockpile of materials (ballasting), the lifting power is amply overdimensioned.
</p>

<p>
The lift trestles shall be made of steel profiles. The lifting gear shall be hydraulic and in case no back-up power supply is arranged, the lifting gear shall also be manually operable.
</p>

<p>
The creepers shall be jointed without a bend. The diameter of the vertical openings for creepers may not exceed the diameter of the bar by more than 4 mm. The pipes shall be injected with cement mortar after completion of the climbing and removal of the bars. 
</p>

<p>
The construction shall be made in such a way that adjustment of a lopsided form is possible. The trestles shall be placed exactly vertical.
</p>

<p>
The sliding formwork shall have devices which hold the cage of reinforcing bars securely in the correct position. Near the top of the form guides shall be mounted. Furthermore, the lengths of reinforcing bars projecting above the concrete shall be supported laterally at suitable levels above the form (depending upon the length of the bars), so as to prevent any lateral movements or deflections of the bars due to any random forces (wind).
</p>

<p>
Working Platforms and hanging platforms shall be supported on the lift trestles in such a way that buckling of the form is avoided.
</p>

<p>
The means of access to the working platforms for workers and for the staff of the Contractor and the Employer's Representative shall be as convenient as possible, and the Contractor shall construct separate scaffolding with stairways or provide a lift or other suitable means of access. 
</p>

<p>
Good night illumination shall be provided, and this shall also include the hanging platforms. 
</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.2	Surface Treatment of Forms</headerIV>


<p>
Any proposed method of treatment of form surfaces by the application of form oil, wax, lacquer or any other kind of coating shall be submitted beforehand to the Employer_s Representative and meet with his acceptance. Such surface treatment may not cause any discolouration of the concrete surface and may not have any other harmful effect whatsoever upon the concrete.
</p>

<p>
Release Agent shall not come into contact with the reinforcement.
</p>

<p>
The same type and make of release agent shall be used throughout the entire area of any finish in one location. The release agent shall be applied evenly, horizontal surfaces last. The minimum necessary amount of release agent shall be used to obtain a clean release. Excessive local collection shall be prevented. The release agent shall be prevented from touching the previously placed hardened concrete, other materials not part of the formwork face and permanent forms to be built into the concrete.
</p>

<p>
The formwork release agents shall be compatible with any waterproofing or coating systems that may be required to be applied to the finished concrete surfaces. The Contractor shall carry out site trials to demonstrate that adhesion of primers to the concrete surface is not reduced and that the performance of the coating systems will not be impaired.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.3	Anchoring of Side Forms</headerIV>

<p>
Side forms shall be solidly anchored by means of round bars and form-clamps or by other acceptable means which are equally effective.
</p>

<p>
The location of anchor bars and spacers shall, on visible surfaces, be arranged in a regular pattern. The pattern shall be naturally harmonized with the contour line of the construction element. A plan for the locations shall be submitted to the Employer's Representative for acceptance.
</p>

<p>
Near construction joints there shall be arranged anchoring which shall be retightened prior to casting being resumed.
</p>

<p>
Where the anchor bars pass through the formwork, they shall be surrounded by a circular cone pressing hard against the inside of the shuttering so as to leave the anchor bar surrounded by a neat, circular hole in the concrete surface with sharp edges. The depth of the hole shall be at least equal to the specified minimum covering of the reinforcing bars.
</p>

<p>
The use of special systems of combined anchor bars and spacers may be used in consultation with the Employer's Representative and shall be subject to his approval. The strength and inflexibility of such combined systems shall be documented by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the Employer's Representative or be demonstrated by tests.
</p>

<p>
In the case of systems leaving holes through the concrete, such holes shall be closed in a satisfactory and efficient manner with regard to the tightness required. As regard the filling of recesses, the provisions of section 4 shall apply.
</p>

<p>
Side forms for edge beams shall be solidly anchored without use of any round bars and form clamps.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.4	Items Embedded in Concrete and Recesses</headerIV>

<p>
The Contractor shall make recesses as specified in the drawings.
</p>

<p>
Temporary steel items embedded in concrete shall be galvanized or painted in a manner and to an extent which will prevent discolouration by rust stains of the adjacent concrete surfaces.
</p>

<p>
All beading, drip edges, chamfers and the like attached to the formwork shall be smooth and shall have a centrally placed longitudinal groove in the side facing the form so as to ensure tightness against the form. The beadings, drip edges, chamfers and the like shall be attached to the formwork by means of screws from the outside. Before the forms are stripped, the screws shall be removed so as to leave the wooden lists in the concrete. Such wooden lists may not be removed until a natural drying-out process has taken place.
</p>

<p>
Where water stops are to be used in construction joints, care must be taken that the water stops are carefully embedded in the concrete at every point and are correctly positioned. During casting the water stops shall be held securely in position by being wedged against the abutting formwork and being tied to the cage of reinforcing bars.
</p>

<p>
Whenever items projecting outside the concrete surface shall be positioned in the concrete cast by slipform procedure, stationary form parts with the necessary openings shall be arranged. Such form parts and items embedded in concrete shall be guided in the form and shall be anchored securely, so no movements are possible during the slipping.
</p>

<p>
Recess forms and items embedded in concrete shall be positioned exactly and securely to the reinforcing bars or special mounting clamps in order to make movements impossible during the slipping.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.5	Preparation of the Forms before Casting</headerIV>

<p>
Reference is made to section 4.
</p>
</subsubsection>



<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.6	Stripping of Formwork</headerIV>


<p>
Stripping of forms shall not be performed prior to the concrete having achieved a maturity corresponding to the required period for protection against drying out as stipulated in the General Note (see Section 4). This is not valid for the substructure work.
</p>

<p>
For the superstructure work earlier stripping is not permitted unless the contractor establishes other kinds of measures, which offers equal protection against drying out in the required period as the steel forms. The Contractors proposal shall be proved during pretesting and accepted by the Employer.
</p>

<p>
Stripping of bearing formwork and scaffolding shall not commence before either the concrete has obtained sufficient strength and stiffness or the construction is made self supporting by tensioning of the prestressing tendons.
</p>

<p>
Stripping shall not take place before it has been demonstrated that the requirements for stresses due to temperature gradients and necessary strength are satisfied, ref. 4.5.7.12.
</p>

<p>
The formwork shall be removed gently and carefully so as to avoid that concrete surface and edges suffer any damage in the process.
</p>

<p>
Hardwood wedges or screw jacks supporting the scaffolding shall be loosened slowly and gradually in a pre-planned sequence so as to avoid the sudden occurrence of any stresses which may be harmful to the structure.
</p>

<p>
Should the Employer's Representative due to the casting performance suspect that the structure is faulty, he may order the Contractor to partially remove the formwork and in this way prove that the casting has been carried out without any fault. Not before this has been proved, will the Employer's Representative allow the scaffolding to be removed. 
</p>

<p>
Any part of the structure at a lower level shall have been stripped of formwork and have been found to comply in all respects with the requirements of the specifications before casting or placing of structures above will be allowed by the Employer's Representative  
</p>

<p>
Regarding weather precautions, ref. is made to section 4.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>1.4.2.7	Maintenance of Formwork</headerIV>

<p>
Formwork which is to be used repeatedly shall be maintained at all times in good condition as to accuracy of shape, strength, rigidity, water/grout tightness and smoothness of surface. The formwork shall be thoroughly cleaned and any repairs required shall be carried out after each use.
</p>

<p>
Damaged or distorted formwork unsatisfactory in any respect shall not be used and shall, if the defects cannot be rectified, be immediately removed from the Site.
</p>
</subsubsection>
</subsection>
</section>



<section>
<headerII>1.5		INSPECTION & TESTING</headerII>

<p>
Vertical movements of the scaffolding, vertical deflections of beams and lateral deflections and distortions of scaffolding and formwork shall be checked throughout the period of casting.
</p>

<p>
For Control of the Slip Form the Following Applies:
</p>

<p>
The form shall be monitored by means of laser or optical instruments to control the form both horizontally and vertically.
</p>

<p>
Prior to commencement of the slip formwork, the Contractor shall submit the proposed format of a slip form logbook to the Employer_s Representative for acceptance. The logbook shall contain  relevant information regarding the slip formwork, such as levels of reinforcing laps, items to be embedded in concrete, recesses etc.
</p>

<p>
During the slip form operation the Contractor shall keep the logbook. The logbook shall form part of the Contractor's QA-documentation into which all relevant observations during the slip form operation shall be entered.

<headerII>2.3	EXECUTION OF THE WORK</headerII>


<subsection>
<headerIII>2.3.1	General</headerIII>


<p>
The reinforcing steel shall be stored on the work site in a tidy and orderly manner thus preventing that steel of different diameters and/or types or quality are being mixed up.
Furthermore, the storage shall be such that the bars are protected against dirt and corrosion as far as is practicable. Reinforcing steel that is to be stored for an extended period shall be stored under roof.
</p>

<p>
All reinforcing steel, including cut and bent reinforcing bars, shall be transported and stored in such a way that it will be exposed as little as possible to salt water or salt spray. Reinforcement so exposed shall be rinsed with fresh water.
</p>

<p>
Bars which are rusted with a rust severity D in accordance with DS 2019 shall be rejected.
</p>

<p>
The reinforcement shown on the drawings shall be considered merely symbolic representations of shape and position and shall not be used by the Contractor to justify any deviation from stipulated requirements (cover, shape and the like). When making the drawings of the reinforcing steel, the prime object has been to give a clear continuous representation of the individual bars from end to end; for that purpose parallel reinforcing bars in the same plane may, for example, have been shown as displaced in the horizontal plane for the purpose of clarity.
</p>

<p>
Before the commencement of the reinforcing steelwork, the Contractor shall himself prepare any supplementary drawings of the reinforcing steelwork as may be required as well as complete cutting lists and bending schedules. The bending schedules shall state the number, shape and overall length of the bar before bending, as well as the total weight in respect of each dimension. Separate bending schedules shall be prepared in respect of the auxiliary bars, such as spacers, chairs and the like, stating numbers required, shape and the total length of the bars before bending.
</p>

<p>
The location of joints in continuous reinforcing bars, not shown on the drawings, shall be submitted to the Employer's Representative for acceptance. If nothing to the contrary has been specified, the number of bars to be joined in any cross section of the structure shall not exceed 1/3 of the total.
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<headerIII>2.3.2	Cutting, Bending and Fixing.</headerIII>

<p>
No cutting or bending of reinforcing steel may be commenced until control of the delivery has been satisfactorily completed.
</p>

<p>
Reinforcing steel shall, as a rule, be bent cold. Such bending shall be done slowly to a diameter D as specified in the General Note.
</p>

<p>
Reinforcing steel bars must not be bent hot, except with the prior approval of the Employer's Representative. All reinforcing bars shall be thoroughly cleaned and free of loose rust, oil, soil, hardened concrete or mortar and the like before being placed in the form.
</p>

<p>
The main reinforcing bars shall be placed with a tolerance + 10 mm. Regarding the minimum concrete cover of the bars in the substructure reference is made to section 2.3.5.
</p>

<p>
Reinforcing bars in grids may be placed with a tolerance of +20 mm in the grid plane. However, the amount of bars per metre shall not be less than prescribed on the drawings.
</p>

<p>
Spacers shall be designed and fabricated with sufficient strength and rigidity and be arranged in a way so as to ensure that the spacer will be properly embedded in the concrete. In visible surfaces, the spacers shall be of the same colour and texture as the surrounding concrete. Spacers shall be made of concrete or cement mortar with a w/c-ratio not exceeding the w/c ratio for the surrounding concrete and with the same type of constituents. The Contractor's proposal for spacers shall be submitted to the Employer's Representative for his acceptance.
</p>

<p>
When using slip forms the Contractor shall demonstrate prior to commencement of the work that the reinforcement can be built in, in such a way that the prescribed tolerances are adhered to.
</p>

<p>
The reinforcement must not have metallic contact with steel which is protruding from the concrete surface.
</p>

<p>
To avoid corrosion at contact points, galvanized structural parts, embedded in the concrete, may not have metallic contact with the reinforcement.

<p>
For load-transmitting as well as non-load-transmitting joints of reinforcing bars from the groups a and b1 and for joints between these bars and other steel items, the Employer's approval will usually be conditional to the Contractor's use of approved welding consumables or use of the standard procedure, ref. DS 894, clause 5 and 6.
</p>

<p>
For all welding of reinforcing steel in group b2 the Contractor must carry out preproduction tests or procedure tests to certify that the yield stress, tensile strength, uniformly distributed elongation, bending characteristics and the fatigue strength are in accordance with special testing methods re. 2.4.1.1. Furthermore, it shall be documented by the Contractor that no substantial metallurgical deviations or geometrical welding defects occur.
</p>

Furthermore, a 5% inspection of all welds shall be carried out by visual inspection and NDT testing. Welds must not show cracks; the quality requirement is based on a comparison with the reference tests.
</p>

<p>
However, for mass produced reinforcement nets or cages the DT and NDT-examination of the tack welds may be reduced provided the Contractor's production control is extended according to the circumstances, and it can be documented by the Contractor that the quality of the welds is not reduced. A reduced examination will not be permitted at start of the mass-production, at changes of production and when new production equipment is put into use.
</p>

<p>
Such reduced NDT-examination is subject to acceptance by the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
In conjunction with load transmitting welding of deformed bars, 1 tensile test shall be performed for every 75 joints. Where the welding is carried out against embedded reinforcement, the control shall be carried out in the same way and under conditions as are prevailing for the reinforcement incorporated in the structure.
</p>

<headerIV>2.4.1.1	Testing Requirements of Welded Joints</headerIV>

<p>
[*ul*]1. Tensile Testing[*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
The Tensile strength and yield stress or 0.2-stress of the welds shall be determined for test pieces with the welds in question and in accordance with DS 10110. With regard to 0.2-stress, a deformation measurement which is described in the following shall be used.
</p>

<p>
When testing welds on short lengths, like joints and cross joints, a measurement length of at least 5 x d shall be used and with the measurement instrument centered over the joint.
</p>

<p>
When testing welds on longer lengths, like overlaps and spliced joint welds, the same measurement length shall be  used, but the measurement instrument shall be placed asymmetrical above one of the extreme points of the welds, as shown in fig. 1.
</p>

<p>









































[*<fig>
Fig. 1. Position of measurement Instrument
[/*fig*]*]
</p>

<p>
The evenly distributed elongation after failure shall be determined by measurement over a distance which, prior to the test, has a length of at least 100 mm.
</p>

<p>
This distance must not include the welds and its starting point shall be at a distance of a least 2.5 x d from the place of failure.
</p>

<p>
[*ul*]Stipulations for the Tensile Tests.[*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
For the tested reinforcing steel bars the following stipulations apply:
</p>

<p>
The yield of the joint, or 0.2-stress, shall be at least equal to either the guaranteed yield, or 0.2-stress, for the steel or to the yield, or 0.2-stress defined, in accordance with clause 5, and must not exceed 92% of the tensile strength of the steel. The evenly distributed elongation after failure A shall not be less than 3% when determined in accordance with clause 1.
</p>

<p>
When butt welding on cold deformed steel bars used for stirrups is being considered the condition of an evenly distributed elongation after failure may be replaced with the condition that the elongation A10 shall be at least 6%, ref. DS 411, clause 6.4.1.4.
</p>

<itemlist>
<itemstart>
Should it not be possible technically to determine the yield of the joint, or 0.2-stress, during the tensile testing of the joint, the stress can be equalled to the characteristical yield, or 0.2-stress, of the reinforcing steel in case the following conditions are complied with:
</itemstart>

<shortitem>a.	The place of failure is outside the welds, which means in a distance of not less than 2 x d from the end point of the welding.</shortitem>

<shortitem>b	The evenly distributed elongation after failure is not less than 3%, re. clause 1.</shortitem>

<shortitem>c.	The tensile strength of the joint is at least 5% higher than the yield, or 0.2-stress, of the unwelded reinforcing steel.</shortitem>
</itemlist>


<p>
[*ul*]2. Bending Test for Welding of Straight Reinforcing Steel.[*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
During testing, the test bar shall be bent around a disc of a diameter which is the double of what is shown in table 4 in DS 13080 for testing of the equivalent unwelded reinforcing bar.
</p>

<p>
The bending angle shall be 60û, and the bending test shall be carried out in such a way that the joint is within the bend area, see fig. 2. The testing shall be carried out with a steel temperature of +10ûC to +30ûC.
</p>

<p>
Tack welds shall be in the tensile zone.
</p>

<p>
For butt welds it is allowed to grind off reinforcement before testing.

</p>

<p>
[*ul*]Stipulations for Bending Tests [*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
In order for the reinforcing steel to pass the bending test is that the bent steel after the test must not show failure or cracks. The examination hereof shall be visual and without the use of optical instruments. It is not important whether a crossbar may become loose during the testing.
</p>

<p>
[*ul*]3. Bending Test for Welds on Bent Reinforcing Steel. [*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
In case a tack welding shall be made on a bend, it shall be proved that the bar has not been harmed by the welding.
</p>

<p>
The testing is carried out by bending the bar 90û around a disc with a diameter which is relevant for the structure.
Thereafter the bend shall be welded to the main bar, fig. 3.a.
The subsequent reverse bending of a total of 20û shall take place, while the steel temperature is 0ûC, fig. 3b.

<headerIII>2.5.4.	Application of Coating</headerIII>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>2.5.4.1	Preparation</headerIV>


<p>
The coating shall be applied to the cleaned surface as soon as possible after blast cleaning and before formation of visible oxidation on the surface. The interval of time between cleaning and application of the coating shall be kept to a minimum. This maximum period shall be related to the temperature and humidity conditions prevailing in the coating plant. However in no case shall the coating be delayed more than 8 hours after cleaning.
</p>

<p>
The cleaned bars shall be pre-heated in approved heating equipment to a temperature between 212ûC (414ûF) and 260ûC (500ûF). Precise temperature requirements shall be determined from pre-production trials incorporating the specified reinforcement configuration.
</p>

<p>
Oxidation of the steel in the form of "blueing" or other apparent oxide formation is not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
The pre-heated reinforcing bars shall be checked for correct temperature using a Tempil Stick or other apparatus acceptable to the Employer's Representative.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>2.5.4.2	Dipping Bath</headerIV>

<p>
The dipping bath shall be of dimensions which enable the reinforcing bars to be freely dipped and to be completely immersed.
</p>

<p>
The method of fluidization shall promote even fluidization and control of bed density.
</p>

<p>
The bed shall be renewed completely if the powder ceases to comply with Clause 2.5.2, 
or if the condition of the powder results in unacceptable deterioration of the finished reinforcing.
</p>

<p>
Periodic testing of samples from the dipping bath shall be taken at regular intervals to ensure that the mechanical properties of the powder is maintained. Type of test and intervals between testing shall be accepted by the Employer's Representative.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>2.5.4.3	Dipping Procedure</headerIV>

<p>
When fluidized to the agreed density, the fluidized bed shall be of a depth adequate for dipping the reinforcing bars.
</p>

<p>
Prior to dipping, the temperature of the bars shall be checked at agreed points on the reinforcement surface at a frequency to be accepted by the Employer's Representative to ensure that the surface temperature does not drop below level considered necessary for coating by the supplier of the powder to be used.
</p>

<p>
Bars shall be dipped at such an orientation as to allow the maximum flow of powder around the reinforcement. The orientation and procedure for dipping shall be established during trials witnessed by the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
Bars shall be continuously agitated when dipped in the fluidized bed.
</p>

<p>
On exit from the dipping tank, the bars shall be blown-off with air to remove any excess powder, without disturbing the coating while it is still in the molten state. The design of the exhaust system shall be appropriate for the size and shape of the bars.
</p>

<p>
The coated bars shall then proceed through a second oven in order to effect full post-cure of the powder.
</p>

<p>
Following curing of the coating, the bars shall be cooled with air or water spray to a temperature that permits handling and inspection.
</p>

<p>
Regular tests for effective curing are to be undertaken. The method of test is to be by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), and testing shall be undertaken each time the plant is stopped and then restarted. The testing shall be at least a minimum of once per day.

<headerIV>2.5.5.1	Coating Film Thickness</headerIV>

<p>
Measured on the body of the reinforcing bar, the film thickness of the coating shall be within 150 and 450 microns. The thickness of coating required is to be established in pre-production trials to satisfy durability and structural requirements and to be appropriate to the dipping orientation. On deformed reinforcement, measurements of the top of ribs using magnetic gauges may not give reliable readings due to the low area available for measurement.
</p>

<p>
The coating time required to provide the specified thickness of coating shall be established during trials witnessed by the Employer's Representative.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>2.5.5.2	Continuity of Coating</headerIV>

<p>
Lifting arrangements during coating shall be designed to minimize discontinuities in coating film.

<p>
The thickness of the coating shall be measured on the body of the bar (between ribs if deformed bars being measured) using an electro-magnetic induction gauge, either an Elcometer 256 or mini test FD-Digital.
</p>

<p>
Gauge calibration with shims shall be performed on a smooth, clean low-carbon steel plate (at least 5800 mm2 x 12.7 mm) rather than on a cleaned reinforcing bar.
</p>

<p>
A correction factor shall then be made to allow for the effect of profile. After smooth calibration, an estimate of the profile effect, based on an average of a set of measurements taken directly on the blast cleaned bar before coating, shall be subtracted from the average of a set of readings on the coated bar.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>2.5.6.2	Holidays</headerIV>

<headerII>3.3	EXECUTION OF THE WORK</headerII>


<subsection>
<headerIII>3.3.1	Storage</headerIII>

<p>
Due to protection against contamination and formation of rust the steel (strands), anchorages, sheathing and the like shall be stored by the supplier and by the Contractor in closed sheds in which the relative humidity of the air is sufficiently low (less than 70%) in order not to cause any formation of rust. The steel shall be stored, raised above the floor, so as to ensure circulation of air under and around it.
</p>

<p>
The completed tendons shall on the site be stored, raised above the ground and protected against contamination and formation of rust. If the tendons are stored for a longer period (more than 1 week) before installation in the form, they shall be covered with watertight material, and ventilation shall be established.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<headerIII>3.3.2	Making-up of Prestressing Tendons and their Installation </headerIII>

<p>
If steel from different batches is being used in the same tendon the mean value of the moduli of elasticity in respect of each batch - determined on the basis of the tests performed at the works - may not differ from one another by more than 3%.
</p>

<p>
If ready-made tendons are supplied, each tendon shall carry the identification numbers of the batches from which the strands were made. The supplier shall keep record of the identification numbers of the coils which were used in the fabrication of the tendon, and shall make such records available upon request.
</p>

<p>
Fabrication, transport and installation of tendons shall be carried out so as to ensure that the tendons remain clean at all times (are laid off temporarily on a clean base) and do not suffer damage of any description. Sheathing which has become dented or otherwise damaged shall be replaced.
</p>

<p>
Strands shall, when uncoiled, straighten themselves out and end up with an acceptable radius of curvature.
</p>

<p>
Due to the danger of damaging the strands the sheathing may, after the tendons have been placed inside the sheathing only be shortened with plate shears (hacksaw or file are not allowed).
</p>

<p>
The strands are allowed to be inserted through sheathings which have in advance been embedded in concrete. Sheathing embedded in concrete shall in this case either be stiffened with temporary incorporated plastic pipes or the like, or shall be made of strengthened sheathing.
</p>

<p>
The tendons shall be securely fixed in the shuttering by means of special carriers and chairs. The sheathing shall be tied securely to each carrier and shall be aligned evenly and smoothly. Where the sheathing joins the anchorage, the straight part of the sheathing shall be precisely in the axis of the anchorage.
</p>

<p>
Projecting ends of strands shall be securely supported.
</p>

<p>
The distances between the supporting points shall be so small that the tolerances for the position of the tendons are not exceeded and unwanted angles are ² 0.3 degrees per metre.

The concrete strength is determined based on maturity measurements, tests of cylinders cast at the same time as the structure and stored on the structure or the like. The Employer's Representative shall be informed of the tensioning in each individual case.
</p>


<p>
Prior to the full tensioning slackening of stressed tendons shall not be allowed, unless the Employer's Representative has given his acceptance.
</p>

<p>
Tensioning shall be carried out in accordance with tensioning lists based on interrelated values of tendon elongation and the tensioning force. Tensioning lists shall be approved by the Employer's Representative. The ascertained elongations and pressure - or stress measurements - shall be entered onto the lists by the Contractor. The lists shall be kept in the Contractor's QA-documentation.
</p>

<p>
Load measurements shall be carried out with a precision of 1%. Tolerances of the elongation shall be +/- 5% per tendon, however +/- 3% average per tendon group. In this connection a tendon group may not consist of more than five tendons.
</p>

<p>
It may be required that the scaffolding be relieved of its load (lowering of the scaffolding) in conjunction with the stressing procedure. In other cases, the scaffolding and the underside shuttering may not be expected removed before the bridge deck is partly post tensioned to a level proposed by the Contractor and accepted by the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
If the elongation of a tendon exceeds the specified tolerances, retensioning after complete detensioning will be requested. If there is a suspicion of burst wires/strands, the tendon may be replaced or a spare tendon may be inserted, and all costs shall be borne by the Contractor.
</p>

<p>
The amount of prestressing steel has been determined, assuming friction values obtained under normal, good workmanship. In case test stressing or the actual tensioning shows a friction loss larger than assumed because the duct after the incorporation has been partly damaged or blocked, or because the values are outside the tolerances, the Contractor shall be obliged to repair the structure.
</p>

<p>
Test stressing shall be carried out for determination of stress loss in jacks and anchorages, and of friction values in the ducts.
</p>

<p>
An approved test laboratory shall verify the accuracy of measurement of the employed equipment.
</p>

<p>
Behind the anchorages, concreting to the stated thickness shall be carried out, after the strands have been cut and in such a way that the prescribed cover of concrete is assured. The strands shall be shortened by using a grinding disc. Shearing or cutting by blowtorch shall not be allowed, if the shortening takes place less than 50 mm from the anchorage. Wire ends which can be embedded directly shall not be shortened. It shall be ensured that the casting has a good adherence to the construction concrete possibly by use of sandblasting and shotcrete.
</p>

<subsection>
<headerIII>3.3.4	Injection (Grouting of the Tendons)</headerIII>

<intro>
<p>
The injection of the grout shall be supervised and directed at all times by a qualified and experienced foreman who is fully conversant with the location and alignment of the tendons, the production of grout, all control measures and all aspects of the grouting operation itself.
</p>

<p>
The Contractor shall submit a programme to the Employer's Representative for acceptance, in which the execution of the grouting is described in detail.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the Employer's Representative has examined the tensioning lists, the grouting shall be carried out. Cutting off reinforcement, protruding after the tensioning and the grouting may, however, not be commenced before the remarks of the Employer's Representative regarding the tensioning lists are available and have been adhered to. Concreting behind the anchorages may not be executed before the grouting, except if it is accepted by the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
With regard to winter conditions reference is made to clause 3.3.4.3.
</p>

<p>
Until the grouting operation has been carried out, the ducts shall constantly be kept free from water by draining through the drains and blowing out with dry compressed air to such an extent as circumstances may require. All openings shall be kept covered, and it shall be ensured that the relative humidity does not exceed 70% inside the ducts, when they are left ungrouted for a longer period. This requirement also applies to ducts which have not yet been embedded in concrete.
</p>
</intro>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>3.3.4.1	Grout Production</headerIV>


<p>
The grout shall be prepared immediately before the grouting is due to commence.
</p>

<p>
The grout shall be mixed in a power-driven mixer, with at least 1,000 revolutions per minute. The mixing shall be carried out in accordance with the instructions from the supplier of the admixtures and with due regard to the test results. The mixed grout shall until injection be kept in a separate basin, while being slowly stirred. The time the grout is accepted to be stored depends on the admixtures. This time shall be determined beforehand and shall be accepted by the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
All lumps and impurities shall be removed by running the grout through a suitable sieve.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>3.3.4.2	Execution of the Grouting</headerIV>

<p>
Immediately before the injection takes place, the duct shall be carefully cleaned by compressed air. Where there is a risk that ducts are not passable or there are contacts between ducts, a watertest shall be carried out before the injection. By the water test it shall be checked that ducts are passable and that there are no connections between different ducts. If a short-circuit is found, the Contractor shall prepare a proposal for removing it, and in his injection programme, ref. 3.3.4, this shall be taken into consideration in such a way that the injection of ducts is not hampered. The flush-water shall be removed through drains before the injection. Some water cannot be removed in this way (water in the corrugations of the sheathing). This water shall be removed by the grout, which is being pumped in. The part of the grout which has been diluted with flush-water shall be pumped out.
</p>

<p>
The injection of the grout shall be made by means of a powerdriven, positive displacement piston or membrane type pump. The pump shall be able to supply a pump pressure of not less than 1 N/mm2 (10 bars). The feed pipe connecting the pump with the duct shall be provided with a pressure gauge showing the injection pressure at the inlet. The pump velocity shall be adjusted to the geometry of the tendon and the duct, and it shall be adjusted in a way that the grout has sufficient time to fill up the duct and all cavities in connection with the duct. This includes vents, drainpipes and the specially formed parts at anchorages and the like. No cavities with water or air may be left. A laminar flow of grout shall be obtained. The grout front shall have a velocity of 6-12 m per minute. As inlets the lowest stubs or drainpipes can be used.
</p>

<p>
The injection of a tendon duct shall continue until the grout flows out of the other end of the tendon duct and the vents in a continuous stream which is entirely free from air bubbles and water and has the same consistency and quality as the grout being pumped in.
</p>

<p>
Air vents and drains shall be closed as and when reached by the stream of grout and when the above has been satisfied. The closing may be carried out by plugging with a wooden wedge or the like or by bending the pipe stub. Finally the inlet stub including the injection nozzle may be closed. The closing shall be carried out either by bending the inlet stub or by closing an inserted tap in such a way that no injected grout runs out and the pressure is maintained. At completion of the injection it shall be ensured that the grout has no possibility of seeping out.
</p>

<p>
Grouting shall only be commenced when the temperature of the structure is between +5û C and +25û C, unless special precautions are introduced with regard to heating or cooling.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the grouting operation, compressed air and water under pressure (minimum 0.1 N/mm2) shall be immediately available for the purpose of cleaning and flushing the duct, if the grouting process, for some reason, cannot be successfully completed.
</p>

<p>
Spare pumps and spare mixing equipment shall be present as may be required.
</p>

<p>
Primary precautions shall be taken to secure the complete filling of anchorage "trumpets" and top points of sheathing, e.g. by a later injection of these, at a time before the grout has set. Methods to be described in the grouting programme.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>3.3.4.3	Injection under Winter Conditions</headerIV>

<p>
Even if the ducts have been kept free from ice, injection shall only be allowed if the ducts for not less than 48 hours prior to commencement of the injection have been kept at a temperature higher than +3û C.
</p>

<p>
Flushing, if any, of the ducts prior to injecting must not bring the temperature below +3û C.
</p>

<p>
At the time of grouting the grout shall have a temperature between +5û C and +25û C. Mixer, storage basin, tubes, valves etc. shall be secured in such a way that cooling of the grout is avoided. The injected ducts shall be kept at a temperature not less than +3û C, until the grout is frost resistant, ref. clause 3.4.1.2.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the injection, tests shall be carried out to determine the frost resistance limit, ref. clause 3.4.1.2.
</p>

<p>
It shall be ensured that the temperature in the tendon duct does not exceed +25û C.

<subsubsection>
<headerIV>3.4.1.1	Prestressing Steel and Anchorages</headerIV>


<p>
The prestressing steel shall be tested to demonstrate the properties with regard to geometry, strength and deformation and to determine the modulus of elasticity of the steel.
</p>

<itemlist>
<itemstart>
The test includes the following:
</itemstart>

<shortitem>1.		The manufacturer's test (factory test) including preparation of certificates of inspection as specified in clause 3.2.1.</shortitem>

<shortitem>	2.		Random testing in connection with the production or supply of the tendons.</shortitem>
</itemlist>

<p>
The random testing shall either be carried out in a laboratory approved by "The Danish State's Technical Test Board", and the test pieces shall be selected in the presence of the Employer's Representative or be carried out in accordance with a control system accepted by the Employer's Representative and arranged in co-operation with a laboratory approved by "The Danish State's Technical Test Board".
</p>

<p>
Random testing of the steel includes determination of Pau, load for 1% elongation alternatively P0.2, E, the minimum elongation corresponding to the maximum load, diameters and a plot of load-elongation curves.
</p>

<p>
The random testing shall be carried out with one piece for each 25 t of supplied steel, however, not less than three pieces for each delivery and batch.
</p>

<p>
In case the prestressing steel is not included in the above approved control system, the following applies:

<p>
The tendon supplier shall when supplying complete tendons prepare a production and delivery plan comprising the time schedule for the production of tendons so that random samples may be taken.
</p>

<p>
The random pieces shall be taken as accepted by the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
Test certificates shall be submitted to the Employer's Representative prior to commencement of the casting.
</p>

<p>
The Contractor will not be allowed to commence casting of the structure, before acceptable test results have been submitted to the Employer's Representative. This implies that the Contractor shall be able to positively identify the steel.

<headerIV>3.4.1.2	The Grout</headerIV>


<p>
[*ul*][*bold*]a. Test Methods [*/bold*][*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
[*bold*]Water-Cement Ratio [*/bold*]: The mix proportion shall be controlled by weighing each of the components. In case the water is dosed according to volume, the volume of the measuring basin shall be checked.
</p>

<p>
[*bold*]Fluidity [*/bold*]: The fluidity is determined by measuring the time it takes for 2 litres of grout from a full funnel to run into a 2 litre measuring glass. The funnel shall be moistened before being filled with grout. The dimensions of the funnel shall be: Total height 340 mm, of which the lower 35 mm is a cylindrical spout with an internal diameter of 12.5 mm and the upper 75 mm is a cylindrical flange with internal diameter of 177 mm. The piece between the two cylindrical parts is 230 mm high and formed as a truncated cone between the two diameters.
</p>

<p>
To secure that the grout can be pumped during the injection, the fluidity of the grout shall be determined immediately after mixing, and thereafter each quarter of an hour (first time, however, after 30 minutes) until the grout has been pumped into the tendon duct.
</p>

<p>
[*bold*]Expansion, bleeding and reabsorption [*/bold*]: These qualities shall be measured in a clear glass or plastic cylinder (diameter 50-100 mm and height 200-300 mm), which shall be 3/4 filled and then covered with a tight lid. Readings shall be carried out after 1, 3 and 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
Bleeding (separation of water from the grout) = C/A x 100%.

	            	B - A
			Expansion =        	x 100%

						A
</p>

<p>
where

			A = The original height in mm of the grout test sample.
			B = The grout height in mm at a specific time.
			C = The height in mm of clear water.
</p>

<p>
The results shall be determined as a mean value of not less than 2 tests.
</p>

<p>
The test samples shall be selected immediately after the mixing as well as from the outlet from the tendon duct.
</p>

<p>
[*bold*]Compressive strength [*/bold*]: Not less than 3 cubes 100 x 100 x 100 mm shall be cast from grout selected from the outlet (flow) of the tendon ducts. The cubes shall be stored, in accordance with DS 423.21, in water with a temperature of +20û C +/- 4û C until the compression test after 28 days.
</p>

<p>
[*bold*]Frost resistance: [*/bold*] Frost resistance of the grout, expressed by the number of degree curing hours at +15û C, the grout needs to pass the following test:
</p>

<p>
The test shall be carried out with a dilatometer, which consists of a one litre measuring glass with a tight lid. The glass shall be filled completely with a mixture of 50% ethylene-glycol and 50% water. The lid shall be equipped with a filling pipe with a tap, an air vent and a riser-pipe with a scale on which changes in the volume can be read.
</p>

<p>
The grout, which shall be tested after a known "maturity" (+15û C) shall be placed in a plastic bag inside the glass. The temperature shall be measured by means of thermo couplers which are connected to the grout sample. During cooling the volume of the grout will be reduced proportionally with the temperature until the capillary water freezes to ice. By this the temperature will increase (due to the heat which is released when the water freezes) and the time of freezing is known. If the grout is not expanding, it can be considered frost resistant.
</p>

<p>
By calculation (before cooling) of "degree of curing" converted into "degree curing hours" at +15û C a summation is carried out of the product h x f (t), where h = the number of hours the grout has had the temperature tû C and f(t) = a temperature dependent factor, which can be seen in the table below:
</p>

<p>
			t    2   4   6   8   10  12  14  15  16  18  20  22  24
			f(t) 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.9
</p>

<p>
To determine exactly when the grout is frost resistant, it is necessary to test minimum 3 grout samples with different "maturity" (15û C).
</p>


<p>
[*ul*][*bold*]b. The Extent of the Testing [*/bold*][*/ul*]
</p>

<p>
Tests which will prove that all components are suited for the grout production shall be carried out.
</p>



<p>
[*ul*][*bold*]Grout, advance testing [*/bold*][*/ul*]:
</p>

<p>
The suitability of the mortar shall be documented by pre-testing.
</p>

<shortitem>-	the temperature of the grout</shortitem>
</itemlist>

<p>
Before injection works under winter conditions may be implemented, a recognized laboratory shall carry out tests in order to establish the limit of the frost constancy of the grout.
</p>


<p>
[*ul*][*bold*]The grout, control testing [*/bold*][*/ul*]:
</p>

<p>
The structure is, with regard to control, divided into several injection stages (control sections).
</p>

<p>
As a minimum the following shall be carried out for each injection stage:
</p>

<p>
One fluidity measurement when injection starts and after each stoppage of the injection work. The sample shall be taken directly from the mixing or storage basin. After that the fluidity measurement shall currently be carried out at intervals of not more than 3 hours.
</p>

<p>
For each injection stage at least 5 fluidity measurements shall be taken of grout selected from the outflow from the tendon duct.
</p>
<p>
One expansion, water separation and reabsorption measurement of grout selected from the mixing or storage basin.

<headerIV>3.4.2.2	Injection</headerIV>


<p>
The extent of the testing during injection is specified in clause 3.4.1.2.
</p>

<p>
When removing the injection stubs after the grout has set, the filling of the stubs shall be examined. If the stubs are not properly filled, further examination shall be carried out in order to reveal the cause of this deficiency. In case new examination reveals defective injection of cables, these shall be remedied in consultation with the Employer's Representative.
</p>

<p>
The Contractor shall prepare control log book with documentation for all injection works. Such documentation shall contain information of importance for evaluation of the work carried out. The information shall include used materials and equipment, time and date, weather and temperature conditions, quantities used and information regarding test results for fluidity, expansion, water separation and change in volume, and further the results from the compressive strength test. Further, the observations from examination of the stubs and the followup to these examinations shall be recorded.

<p>
Furthermore the documentation shall contain information about the injection programme, location of stubs, inlets, outlets, deviations from closing sequences and other details which also include stoppages, leaks etc.
</p>
<p>
The documentation shall be part of the Contractor's QA-documentation.
</p>
</subsubsection>


<subsubsection>
<headerIV>3.4.2.3			Injection under Winter Conditions</headerIV>

<p>
When injection of tendon ducts shall take place under winter conditions, the temperature in the sheathing shall be followed before, during and after the injection, until the frost constancy of the grout has been documented. The measurement points can be established inside the ducts or immediately next to the sheathing. However, at least one point at the estimated most critical location.
</p>

<p>
In case automatic temperature registration is not being used, the temperature shall be measured 3 times every 24 hours and the maximum interval between 2 measurements shall be 12 hours. Each measurement shall apart from the measured temperature contain the time and air temperature.
</p>

<p>
When calculating the obtained degree of curing of the grout pumped into the tendon duct, the method stated in clause 3.4.1.2 "Frost constancy" shall be used.
</p>

<p>
Injected tendon ducts shall everywhere be ensured a temperature of not less than +3û C, and this shall be the case until the documented degree of curing converted to 15û C exceeds the grout limit for frost constancy, see clauses 3.4.1.2 and 3.3.4.3.

The Contractor shall make allowance for the following requirements:
</itemstart>

<item>
<p>
a) 	The concrete shall be protected against evaporation from the surface.
</p>

<p>
Unless another procedure has been proven acceptable, the protection shall be established before 1.5 kg/m2 of water has evaporated from the surface. The rate of evaporation shall not exceed 0.50 kg/m2/hour.
</p>

<p>
This amount of water corresponds to a concrete thickness in excess of 0.20 m. If the thickness is less than 0.20 m, the allowable quantity of evaporated water shall be reduced proportionately.
</p>

<p>
The protection may need to be established temporarily, before the screeding is carried out.
</p>


<p>
Unless another procedure has been proven acceptable, the protection against evaporation shall remain in place until the maturity of the concrete, as stated in the General Note (equivalent hardening time at + 20oC), has been obtained in the surface layer of the concrete (measured in a depth of maximum 10 mm).  
</p>

<p>
If the setting starts later than 5 hours after the mixing, the requirement for maturity will be increased proportionally.
</p>
</item>

<shortitem>b)	The cast concrete shall be protected against water erosion. </shortitem>

<shortitem>c)	The concrete shall be protected against frost, until the concrete has hardened sufficiently to be frost resistant. Prior to the commencement of the casting, the safety against freezing shall be documented. When the temperature is -50û C and below the Contractor may not be allowed to cast. If the weather forecast for the coming days is predicting bad weather, the Contractor may not be allowed to carry out the planned casting.</shortitem>

<shortitem>d)	The maximum temperature of the concrete during hardening must not exceed 50û C unless it is documented that the strength after 112 days of hardening is not reduced. The concrete temperature must, under no circumstances, exceed 70û C. </shortitem>

<item>
<p>
e)	In a deck or wall for which thermal expansion is not obstructed by neighboring structures, the difference between the mean concrete temperature and the surface temperature must not exceed 15û C. This will normally correspond to a temperature difference between the middle and the surface of the structure, not exceeding 20û C.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the mean temperatures of neighboring decks and/or walls cast at the same time shall not exceed 20û C.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the mean temperature of earlier casts and of neighboring, newly cast decks and/or walls shall not exceed 12û C.
</p>

<p>
The above temperature differences may only be exceeded if it is documented that the tensile stresses arising from the temperature differences are always less than the current tensile strength of the concrete.
</p>
</item>

<shortitem>f)	Stripping, post-tensioning and the carrying of traffic and other loads on structural parts can only take place after the Contractor has demonstrated that the structure has obtained the necessary strength. The demonstration shall be based on temperature registrations in the structure.

Two plastic bottles containing a reference sample of 2% Ca(OH)2 solution in accordance with Table 1 are produced and marked 0 and dated.

The plastic bottles are placed in the heating cabinet (5.1) at 50û C. The bottles are shaken once a week.


8.	Analysis

8.1 	Sampling for Chemical Analysis 

After 20 weeks samples form the solutions, including the reference samples, are taken. The volume of the samples can be seen from Table 1. The sample is transferred to a graduated cylinder where it is diluted with water to 1/10 concentration as per Table 1.

If several samples are to be analyzed, portions of the samples can be transferred to a plastic container with lid (5.6). The container shall be completely filled with the liquid. For each of such samples the plastic container shall be marked with the sample number, date and time.


8.2	Calibration of Results

Standard 100 ppm solutions are prepared from the stock solutions 6.3 and 6.4 by taking 100 ml of the stock solution by pipette and transferring it to a 1000 ml graduated cylinder. The cylinder is then filled with water (6.1).

Calibration standards are then prepared at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ppm (e.g. by taking 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ml of solution by pipette and dilute with water to 1000 ml in a measuring cylinder).

The calibration standards should be prepared together with the analysis samples.
The calibration standards shall be analyzed by flame photo-emission/atomic absorption.

The calibration curves shall be produced as described in the manual of the flame photometer/atomic absorption instrument.

9.	Method of Analysis

The diluted portion samples (8.1) including the reference samples shall be analyzed for sodium and potassium by either flame photometry or atomic absorption. If the concentration of Na2O or K2O in a diluted portion is greater than 5 ppm it shall be further diluted. The reference sample shall be correspondingly diluted and these shall be entered into the calculation (10.3). 30 ml of the diluted sample is removed for analysis.

The content of both Na2O and K2O in the diluted samples is calculated from the calibration curves.


10.	Calculation of Results

10.1	Preliminary Calculations

CV 	=	  c x V1 x V2    (ppm)		(f 10.1)
v1 x v2       



where

CV	=	alkali content of the sample in the sample bottle, (ppm).

c	=	content of either Na2O or K2O as calculated (9) form the calibration curve (8.2), (ppm).

v1	=	volume of the portion for analysis, 8.1 (ml).

V1	=	graduated cylinder volume into which the portion for analysis was first diluted (ml).

v2 and V2 =	similar to v1 and V1, however only to the extent that further dilution under point 9 has been necessary. (If a third dilution is necessary an extra v3/V3 multiplication is introduced into f 10.1). 	 


10.2	Analysis Result

For calculation of the alkali content of the portion under analysis.

C	=	CV x V x 10-4/m (mass %)(f 10.2)

where

C	=	portions alkali content (calculated for both Na2O and K2O) (mass %).

CV	=	from f 10.1.

V	=	the volume of the solution in the sample bottle (ml). 

m	=	the mass of the portion (g).


10.3	Adjustment of Results

If the reference samples contain sodium and/or potassium, the results of the analysis shall be adjusted.

Cp	=	C - Co (mass %)	(f 10.3)

where

Cp	=	the portions calculated alkali content (for both Na2O and K2O) adjusted for the reference sample content (Co) (mass %).

C	=	from f 10.2

Co	=	the reference samples content of Na2O and/or K2O (mass %) calculated from the average of 2 tests.


10.4	Presentation of Results

Upon completion of the above calculations for both Na2O and K2O for each of the portions the alkali content is stated for each of the portions. The uncertainty range for the results shall be stated. This can, for example, be estimated by calculating the dispersion of the averages of the values for the tests. The result is given as mass %.

7.	Sample Preparation

(For reasons of safety, preparation of the sample should be performed in a fume cupboard and safety glasses and rubber gloves should be worn.)

If a sugar solution has been added to the sample the mass of the sample should be determined immediately on receipt in the laboratory. 

Two representative portions shall be taken from the fresh concrete, each of approx. 500 g. (The sample can if required be quartered using a plastic tray of approx. 0.3 to 0.5 m2 with holes for a plastic jar (5.4)). Each portion is placed in a plastic jar which are each marked with the sample number and either a -1 or a -2 and the mass of the jars and content are determined. 300 ml of hydrochloric acid (6.2) is added to each sample whilst the samples are shaken (NB an overpressure will develop and this must be released). The samples shall be strongly agitated several times during the following 10 minutes. 400 ml of water are added to the samples while mixing and the jars are strongly agitated before being allowed to stand for 3 hours ± 15 minutes.

After 3 hours the samples are strongly agitated and a short time later a 10 ml test sample is taken from the top of each portion. This test sample is placed in a 1000 ml graduated cylinder. If necessary the test sample is filtered. The test sample is diluted with water to 1000 ml.

Shortly hereafter the diluted test samples are analyzed for sodium and potassium. If several test samples shall be analyzed the test sample can be transferred to a plastic jar with lid (remember marking!).


8.	Calibration of Measurement Results

Standard 100 ppm solutions are prepared from the stock solutions 6.4 and 6.5 by taking 100 ml of the stock solution by pipette and transferring it to a 1000 ml graduated cylinder. The cylinder is then filled with water.

Calibration standards are the prepared at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ppm and containing CaO in order to reduce the error from interference from calcium (e.g. by taking 10, 20, 30, 40 & 50 ml of 6.4 and 6.5 solutions by pipette and placing it in a 1000 ml graduated cylinder. 10 ml of the stock CaO solution (6.6) is also added to the 1000 ml graduated cylinder and the cylinder is diluted with water). A further 10 ml. of CaO stock solution (6.6), using pipette is taken.

The calibration standards shall be prepared together with the test samples. The calibration standards are analyzed using flame photometry/atomic absorption and the emissions/absorptions registered.
 
The calibration curves shall be produced as described in the manual of the flame photometer/atomic absorption instrument.


9.	Method of Analysis

v1 x v2

where 

C	=	acid soluble alkali content in the portion (calculated for both Na2O and K2O) (mass %)

c	=	content of either Na2O or K2O calculated (9) from the calibration curve (8) (ppm)

V	=	volume of HC1 and water added to each portion (ml)

v1	=	volume of the test sample removed for the jar (ml)

V1	=	volume of the graduated cylinder into which the removed test sample is diluted

v2 and V2	=	used only where further dilutions under point 9 have been necessary. v2 then signifies the volume of a sample taken from V, and V2 signifies the volume of the graduated cylinder in which the sample was diluted (ml)

m	=	mass of each portion (g). If sugar and water have been added at the time of sampling, the m shall be corrected by multiplication of the ratio of the sampled mass mp and the mp with sugar and water added.


10.2	Presentation of Results

Upon completion of the above calculations for both Na2O and K2O for each of the portions the alkali content is stated. The uncertainty range for the results shall be stated. This can, for example, be estimated by calculating the dispersion of the averages of the values for the tests. The result is given as mass %.

<headerIV>4.5.10.9	Determination of Heat Generating Properties by Adiabatic Calorimetry</headerIV>

<p>
Principle

A container with approximately 5 liter of the concrete to be tested is placed in an adiabatic calorimeter. The concrete hardens under adiabatic conditions i.e. without loss of heat. The adiabatic temperature rise is measured as a function of time, and the specific development of heat Q is calculated as function of the maturity development of the concrete.

 	The parameters Q°, t  and a  are calculated.

The concrete specimen shall be placed in the calorimeter at the latest 1/2 hour after the addition of water to the concrete. The time shall be measured from the addition of water, and the test shall be continued corresponding to a minimum of 500 maturity hours.

<headerIV>4.5.10.10	Supplement to DS 423-31 "Pull-out Test for Hardened Concrete"</headerIV>

<p>
Positioning of tests individual trials, acceptance criteria for correct testing and directions for repair of extraction holes for LOK-TEST and CAPO-TEST systems are covered herein:

1.	Positioning of a tests' individual trials

1.1	LOK-TESTS & CAPO-TESTS are placed in the same 5 cm from reinforcement

1.2	A test's individual trial is placed in the same horizontal layer with regard to the minimum distance to the edge given in DS 423.31

2.	Acceptance criteria for correct testing

2.1	For LOK-TEST using L-40 test inserts

2.1.1	Pull-out bolt (L-16) with centre washer (L-15) and coupling (L-13) shall be screwed 6_ turns into the cast-in disk, otherwise the test is disregarded

Reason:	LOK-TEST insert disks shall be placed 25 mm under the test surface. 

2.1.2	The activated LOK-TEST instrument shall be able to be coupled to the coupling (L-13) with centre washer (L-15 and pull-out bolt (L-16) screwed 6 turns into the cast-in disk, otherwise the test is disregarded.

Reason:	LOK-TEST inserts axle shall be at right angles to the test surface.

2.1.3	If the loading under testing to breakage in the concrete is interrupted the test is disregarded.

Reason:	Repeated testing will reduce the test result.

2.1.4	After testing the breakage cone shall be visible on the test surface bounded by holders 55 mm inner diameter, otherwise the test is disregarded.

Reason:	The trial shall be loaded to breakage as the maximum result is desired.

2.1.5	If other signs of breakage or spilling outside of the circular 55 mm break occurs, the test is disregarded.

Reason:	The test surface shall be plane.

2.1.6	The LOK-TEST instrument shall be recalibrated if the manometer is replaced, in case of service inspection or in case the instrument has been overloaded. However, calibration shall occur at least once per 1000 tests or at least once per year, otherwise the tests are disregarded.

Reason:	The LOK-TEST instrument's true and indicated pulling force shall be registered and shall be stable.


2.2	For CAPO-TEST

2.2.1	If the loading under testing to breakage in the concrete is interrupted, the test is disregarded.

Reason:	Repeated testing will reduce the test result

2.2.2	If other breakage signs or spilling outside of the circular 55 mm break boundary at the holders inner diameter occur after complete pull-out of the cone, the test is disregarded.

Reason:	The test surface shall be plane.

2.2.3	If the depth from the test surface to the cut CAPOTEST recessed edge towards the test surface is outside of the tolerance 25 mm ± 0.2 mm, the test is disregarded.

Reason:	The CAPO insert in the expanded condition shall be positioned 25 mm under the test surface.

2.2.4	If the diameter of the expanded CAPO-insert after extraction of the cone is outside of the tolerance 25 mm ± 0.5, the test is disregarded.

Reason:	The CAPO-insert shall be fully expanded under test.

2.2.5	If the diameter of the cut CAPO-TEST holes is outside of the tolerance 25 mm + 0,5 - 0,0 mm the test is disregarded.

Reason:	The CAPO-TEST hole shall be cut to 25 mm + 0.5 - 0.0 mm.
2.2.6	If foreign bodies are found in the breakage cone after pull-out the test is disregarded.

Reason:	It is the compressive strength of the concrete which shall be measured.

2.2.7	The LOK-TEST instrument shall be recalibrated if the manometer is replaced, in case of service inspection or in case the instrument has been overloaded. However calibration shall occur at least once per 1000 tests or at least once per year, otherwise the tests are disregarded.

Reason:	The LOK-TEST instrument's true and indicated pulling force shall be registered and shall be stable.

3.	Repair of Break Hole

3.1	LOK-TEST Break

3.1.1	If the break cone has not lifted more than 1 mm above the test surface, a two part rapid hardening epoxy is injected into the 11 mm stem hole to fill the hold and cracks.

3.1.2	Otherwise the break cone is extracted fully. If the LOK-TEST instruments 5 mm travel is insufficient to remove the cone, a special removal instrument is used. The hole in the concrete is repaired with a polymer modified concrete.

3.1.3	Withdrawn LOK-TEST bolts may not be re-used.

3.2	CAPO-TEST Break

The hole in the concrete is repaired using polymer modified concrete.

<subsection>
<headerIII>5.4.10	Casting of the Concrete</headerIII>

<p>
All areas in which there is to be bond between steel or hardened concrete and fresh concrete placed under water, shall be thoroughly cleaned immediately prior to beginning placements. Cleaning shall be accomplished using water jetting. Airlifts or pumps shall be used to remove mud, silt, or sand from placement areas.
</p>

<p>
The placement shall begin with the tremie pipe sealed with a watertight plate. The empty tremie pipe shall be sufficiently heavy to be negatively bouyant when empty. "Rabbits" or "go- devils" shall not be used to start the tremie. The tremie shall be sealed, lowered to the bottom, and filled with concrete. The tremie shall then be lifted 150 mm to initiate concrete flow. Concrete supply shall be continuous until soundings indicate the required embedment is developed.
</p>

<p>
Placement of tremie concrete shall be a continuous operation. Placement shall continue uninterrupted until the entire placement is completed. Interruptions of placement through a single tremie shall not exceed 30 minutes without removal of the tremie and carrying out the restarting procedure.
</p>

<p>
The concrete placement rate shall be sufficient to produce a minimum vertical rise of concrete of 0.2 m/hr, calculated by dividing the entire placement area by the concrete production rate.
</p>

<p>
Tremie pipes shall be spaced to give a maximum concrete flow distance of 10 m.
</p>

<p>
The mouth of the tremie shall remain embedded in the fresh concrete at all times unless the tremie is being completely removed from the water. At no time shall concrete be allowed to fall through water. Embedment shall be from 1 to 1.5 m at all times.
</p>

<p>
A tremie shall not be moved horizontally while concrete is flowing through it. To relocate a tremie, it shall be lifted from the water, resealed, relocated, and restarted.
</p>

<p>
All vertical movements of the tremie shall be carefully controlled to prevent loss of seal. If loss of seal occurs, placement through that tremie shall be halted immediately. The tremie shall be removed, resealed, replaced and restarted.
</p>

<p>
Tremies shall be relocated during the placement in accordance with the placement plan and as indicated by soundings.
</p>

<p>
If circumstances force a suspension in placement greater than the time of initial set, then the surface of the concrete shall be green-cut after the concrete has set. Placement shall not be resumed until the concrete surface has been cleaned by water jetting. 
</p>

<p>
Airlifts or pumps shall be provided to remove laitance with accumulates during placement. Airlifts and pumps shall be relocated as indicated by soundings.
