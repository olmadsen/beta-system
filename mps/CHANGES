Changes log for ~beta/mps (The Metaprogramming System)
======================================================
OLM: Oct. 19, 2000:
A few minor changes to hnadsle experiment with newindex.bet file;
added virtual pattern son to AST - only binding is in expanded.
 
OLM: Oct. 12, 2000:
Removed astlevel:fragmentGroup::getBinding, which was in use.
The compiler uses  betaast/index.bet::ASTindex:getBinding
which has been moved to the file betaast/getslotbinding.bet.
Added: utils/getslotbindings.bet

OLM: April 12, 2000:
Added utils/ast2asciiMap.bet to keep track of line numbers
when parsing files. Changes to fragmentGroupparser and
astparser.

ESS March 9, 2000:
Moved local editor implementation of the code for following semantic 
links (declRef and virtDcl)to mps/utils/safesemanticlinks.bet.
It must be decided whether this safe implementation should
replace the mps implementation. In that case no changes
has to be made in betasematt.bet and the following two
operations can be avoided.

safeDclRef:
  (* like betasematt.declRef except that it does not crash if the
   * the semantic link is undefined, instead it returns NONE
   *)
  (# aplNode,dclNode: ^astInterface.ast
  enter aplNode[]
  do ((1,aplNode[])->safeGetNodeAttribute)->dclNode[]; 
  exit dclNode[]
  #);
safeVirtDcl:
   (* like betasematt.virtDecl except that it does not crash if the
   * the semantic link is undefined, instead it returns NONE
   *)
 (# aplNode,dclNode: ^astInterface.ast; f: ^astInterface.ast
  enter aplNode[]
  do
     aplNode.father->f[];
     f.father->f[];
     ((1,f[])->safeGetNodeAttribute)->dclNode[]
  exit dclNode[]
  #)  

To see the difference between the implementations, 
follow the semantic links in 
editor/private/codeditorbody-hasSemanticLinks:

(if true then
    theNameApl[]->mps.safeDclRef->node[]
 else
    'hasSemanticLinks: calling old semantic links code (dclRef)'->putLine;
    theNameApl.dclRef->node[]
if);
 
M editor/private/codeditorbody.bet
A mps/utils/safesemanticlinks.bet
---

JLK: January 10, 2000:
Added missing LIB_DEF/LIB_ITEM specs.

OLM: December 12, 1999:
Eliminated the slot errMsg and added the declrartions from 
semanticerrortext directly in the slot. Otherwise semanticerrortext
would always  have tro be included when using msp.

OLM: December 5, 1999:
Added slot errMsg in astPrivate to handle dynamically generated error
messages.

OLM: December 18, 1998:
Added handling of splitstring grammar property that makes it possible
to split a string into several substrings:
	'xxxx' 'yyyy' 
may be lexed as
       'xxxx<0>yyyy'
This requires the property
	 splitstring = true
in the grammar. 

ESS: October 31st, 1998:
Corrected the bug that the modtime of the original was modified
in saveAs. Removed the use of the backupUpExt attribute in 
saveBackup, recoverBackup and saveAs and instead
added a filename parameter to pack and unpack.
If the parameter is none, diskFileName is used.

JLK: June 30, 1998:

Made cleanup in the 'modtime' setting code in 'pack' - several resent
changes were not really correct (especially not with respect to
errorhandling and wrt. save of backup files)

Prepared to used 'cached' file informations.

Corrected the 'LIB_ITEM' settings in several MPS files.

JLK: June 27, 1998:

Removed the automatic cleanup code inserted June 17,1998 due to
unexpected sideeffects.

Inserted updating of 'fg.modtime' after openWrite to ensure the
correct value.

JLK: June 17, 1998:

Changed the exception handling in two ways.  

Firstly, the exception handling code now tries to do automatic cleanup
(none->thecatcher).  This should relieve the users of MPS from having
to do this very low-level cleanup in the future. (efter forslag fra Ole).

Secondly, the virtual exception declarations concerning these
exceptions have been rearranged.  This have influenced operations such
as top.open, saveAs, markAsChanged, and several others (all with MPS
exception handling) - however, their semantics and usage are totally
identical.  The rearrangement is, that a new pattern have been
defined: 'protect', which containg all the virtual exception handling
devclarations plus the implkemantation of the basic propagation
mechanism (which was repeatedly and identically implemented in the
above mentioned operations).  The above mentioned operations are now
subpatterns of 'protect' and thus inherits the virtual exception
handling.

The reason for this rearrangement of exception handling is, that Sif
have reported missing abilities to catch exceptions from MPS.  The
example is, that Sif e.g. makes a new lexem node (using the
'newLexemText operation).  This operation may result in ast-overflow,
but there is no way to 'catch' such exceptions in the previous MPS
design.  'Protect' is a solution to this in the following way.

Assume, that you make a series of MPS operations, where some of these
may give rise to MPS exceptions:

	...
	...newLexemText...
	...

To catch MPS exceptions from any of these operations, use the following:

	protect
	  (# astOverflow:: (# ...handle ast overflow... #);
	     ...etc. for the rest of the MPS exceptions...
	  do ...
	     ...newLexemText...
	     ...
	  #)

Actually, we could remove exception handling virtual from the above
mentioned operations, such as top. open, since using 'protect', these
can be written as:

	protect
	  (# astOverflow:: (# ... #);
	     ...etc...
	  do ...top.open;...
	  #)

but these exceptions are preserved in e.g. top.open for backward
compatability reasons.

Furthermore, the virtuals: 
	EOLasComEnd:< FalseObject;
etc. in 'parse' have been changed to:
	EOLasComEnd:< booleanValue;
to enable the more easy usage:
	EOLasComEnd:: trueObject;
(efter forslag fra Peter)

=============================================================================
mps/v5.2

JLK: Sept. 22, 1997:

Added initialization of modtime just before starting 'pack' (to ensure
proper value of modtine in the case of e.g. not having write
premission later in the pack).

JLK: Wed Aug  6 16:13:21 MET DST 1997

Ensured that the linklist cache of include links are cleared when new
properties are parsed (e.g. in parseproperty in propertyparser.bet)

Changed allocation of getNextComment to be dynamic, to save space.

Added fragmentScanner.bet (lifted from editor and 'modernized').

JLK: Fri Jul 18 12:26:24 MET DST 1997

Made yet another optimazation of scanIncludes (lightweight list)

JLK: Fri Jul 18 00:20:00 MET DST 1997

Removed operations 'isAlreadyopen' and 'isreferenced' (old, unused).

Changed scanIncludes to be more efficient.  Now caches the include
list, and the fullname of these.  Implies changes in usages of
scanIncludes.

OLM: 18/06/97:	Changes in astparser for building AST for unexpanded
		nonterminal or slot to fix listZero problem


Removed GetBETAbindings operation (not used)

===============================================================================
	Changes in release 4.0.1
===============================================================================
Sun Jan 19 13:02:24 MET 1997

Corrected exception handling code in astparser.bet such that AST
overflow etc. exceptions are propagated properly to higher levels.

Sat Jan 18 23:29:24 MET 1997

Corrected error in newAstForParser that made it imply index out of
range errors in the case of extendA only allocating exactly what was
needed.

Sat Jan 05 22:20:00 MET 1997: /jlk

Updated astparser.bet such that it now reports syntaxerror on SLOTs like:

<<SLOT xxxfoo4: hhh: dopart>> and <<SLOT:xxxfoo5: dopart>>


Fri Jan 03 24:00:00 MET 1997: /jlk

Divided astBody.bet into two files: astBody.bet and fragBody.bet 
to avoid problems on SNAKE platform.

Tue Nov 26 15:40:55 MET 1996:	/jlk+ess

During the last 1-2 weeks, we have made numerous changes in MPS in
order to remove several bugs related to grammar initialisation, and in
that process, we have streamlined grammar initialisation immensely.

These changes are mostly done without interface changes, but a few
have been necessary.

Most importantly, the applGram.bet fragment have now become OBSOLETE,
and should not be used any more.

Secondly, a new fragment:
grammarinit.bet 
have been introduced.  It implements all functionality needed for
initialising grammars, including the famous beta-grammar :-)

grammarinit.bet defines two new treelevel operations:

grammarinit
and	betagrammarinit.

If you have a ordinary grammar (i.e. a treelevel object), you can
initialise it using:

(location[],name[],error[])->t.grammarinit; 

where location is a text, containing the grammar file containing the
grammar, and name is a text, containing the name of the grammar, and
finally error is a stream onto which possible error messages might be
written.

E.g.:

mylangCFL: @treelevel;
...
('~beta/grammars/mylang/v1.2/mylang','mylang',screen[])
  ->mylangCFL.grammarInit
    (#
       MPSerror::
	 (# do (failure,msg[])->stop #);
       noParserAvailable::
	 (# do (failure,msg[])->stop #)
    #)


If t represents a beta grammar, you should use:

(location[],name[],error[])->t.betagrammarinit; 

instead to be sure, that the beta grammar is initialised properly for
use by all MBS beta-specific tools.

It should be noted, that if you are using grammarTable.find, the
grammar will automatically be initialized using grammarinit, as
described above.

It should be noted, that the exception handling for operations:
grammarTable.find
and 	findgrammar - fragment

have been changed slightly.  Please consult the interface files for
details.

===============================================================================
	Changes in v5.1
===============================================================================

Added trace on top.close and fg.close (trace.topClose and trace.fragmentClose).

Indført error:: (# do true->continue, (..)->theCatcher #) i alle
file.entry.exists, etc. for at fange diverse file fejl (såsom 'stale NFS
handle') under disse operationer.

Fjernet overflødige ::< (rettet til ::).

Rettet i astPrivate.fragmentListDescriptorPrivate.repRestore for at
sikre, at doubleDeclarationForm bliver kaldt ved unpack, selv om der
ikke parses.

Rettet fejl i fragmentgroupparser, der bet|d, at EOF blev opfattet som
legal end-of-string "'".

Rettet fejl i astPrivate.newAstForParser, som kunne give Repetition
index out of range fejl ved for store ast'er.

Rettet i astPrivate.newLexemTextForParser, som ogs} kunne give
Repetition index out of range fejl ved for store ast'er.  Rettelserne
retter m}ske ikke fejlen, men fejlen er meget vanskelig at
reproducere.  Den foretagne rettelse er mere en 'oprensning', som vil
kunne undg} fejl (men m}ske ikke denne :-().

Rettet fejl i newScan, herunder flyttet "predefined:< ..." ud i
interfacet til newscan.

Introduces usual MPS errorhandling in
	fg.saveAs, fg.saveBackup, fg.restoreBackup, fg.realOpen

Removed ...body: from all fragment form names (redundant).

Introduced use of currentDirectory directly from pathhandler.

Introduced simple-if everywhere.

Changed (if 1//1 then ... if) to (# do ... #) everywhere.

Based on basiclib/v1.5.

===============================================================================
		Changes in v4.9.1-v5.0.1
===============================================================================

No changes have been written down :-(

===============================================================================
		Changes in v4.9
===============================================================================

This release have mostly been modified to fix bugs and raise the efficiency of
the MPS operations.

astlevel.bet
============

One new operation have been added: namedClose.  namedClose can be used to close
a fragment, even in the case where you do not have any BETA reference to the
framgent but only know the name of the fragment.

The operation: indexToNode have been augmented with three exception patterns:
grammarGenArrayError, noSymbol and indexOutOfRange.  These exceptions are
raised in responce to the various errors taht can arise when trying to convert
an ast index to an ast reference.

Three net attributes have been added: astFileExtension, ppFileExtension, and
parserFileExtension.  These operations return the file name extensions to be
expected for the three different file types.

===============================================================================
		Changes in v4.8
===============================================================================

astlevel.bet
============

All scanning operations in astlevel (scan, suffixwalk, etc.) have been changed
to conform to the standard naming convention for scanning operations, namely
that the current element during the scan is called 'current'.  In the pre-v4.8
versions of mps, these variables were called thisElm, thisFragment, thisGroup,
or similar.

A virtual: astOverflow is introduced in ast.copy.  It is invoked if the
internal representation of the AST overflow's.

A new attribute: isOpen is introduced in the fragment pattern.  It returns
true, if the fragment have been opened (and not closed yet).

A new attribute: alreadyOpen is introduced in the fragmentGroup pattern.  It
returns true if the local fragment is already open in this fragment group.

A test for empty localPath is inserted in fragmentGroup.open to avoid errors
later in the processing of fragmentGroup.open.

Fragment.bind is changed such that it automatically tryes to setupOrigin, if
origin is not set previous to the invocation of bind, and the fragment is not
found in this fragment.

FragmentGroup.setupOrigin have been moved up the inheritance hierarchy to
fragment.setupOrigin.

In fragmentGroup.open, it is ensured, that parsing is not done when the file
name contain the grammar file-extension (e.g. .bet for BETA source files such
as xx.bet) - except naturally is the .group-file is older that the source file.

In fragmentGroup.fragmentList.open, it is ensured that the name of
fragmentforms is checked non-case-sensitible.

In fragmentGroup.fragmentList.open, the diskRepresentation is now checked, if
the fragment have been closed since last open.  This is done in order to ensure
that changes made by other tools are reflected now.

In general, many places in the files, tests for read or write access have been
inserted to ensure that no runtime errors should occur due to access problems
to files and directories.

In fragmentForm.indexToNode several runtime test have been inserted to avoid
'nasty' runtime errors due to invalid index'es.

treelevel.init now initializes the genRefArray structure such that 'nasty'
errors does not later occur in indexToNode.

defaultGrammarFinder is a new attribute of astIntergace.  It is a virtual
defining the defauld grammar finder installed during initialization of
astInterface.  Further binding this virtual will install your preferred grammar
finder.

GrammarMissing have been augmented with a few attributes to allow for
registrering grammars and for getting access to the fragmentForm containing the
registered grammars.  Registrering of grammars is now automated through
astLevelInit.

The two changes above imply, that you use one of three possible ways to install
grammars:
	(1) create MPS using:
		ast: @astInterface(# defaultGrammarFinder::< findgrammar #)
	    This is the preferred method for v4.8 and later of MPS.
	(2) or the equivalent:
		astInterface
		  (# defaultGrammarFinder::< findgrammar
                  ...
                  #)
	(3) create MPS the 'old' way:
		ast: @astInterface;
	   and then later install your grammarFinder:
		&findgrammar[]->grammarMissing[];
	   and then register the grammars explicitly:
		grammarMissing.registerGrammars;
	   This is available for 'backward compability' with pre-v4.8 usages of
	   MPS.

An options mechanism have been introduced to control the various workings of
MPS.  Currently only one option is defined (more may be added in the futures).
The optione mechanism is in the form of a new attribute: options, on the
astInterface pattern.  Herein one optin is currently defined: forceParse.  If
	true->options.forceParse 
is executed, MPS will force parsing of all fragments being opened hereafter
(that is, fragments not already opened at that time).

findgrammar.bet
===============

notFound is turned into an exception, not a notification.

A new exception: noRegisteredGrammars is introduced to make it possible to
catch problems with no grammars registered.  If no grammars are registered, MPS
has no way to understand the files to be parsed or loaded.

Two new attriibutes are introduced: grammarsPATH and metaGrammarFile.
   grammarPATH is used to specify the location of the grammars files
(containing the list of valid grammars).  By default, this is initialized to
seek for grammars in current directory, ./.MBSgrammars, ~/.MBSgrammars, and the
standard configuration file from the Mjolner BETA System.
   metaGrammarFile is used to specify the location of the meta-grammar file
(containing the grammar definition grammar).

fragmentgroupparser.bet
=======================

The syntax of fragment groups have been relaxed slightly, since the surrounding
[[ and --]] are made optional, if the fragment group is the only group in the
fragment file.

property.bet
============

The interface to most operations in this fragment have been changed such that
the interface uses text-references instead of text-values.
