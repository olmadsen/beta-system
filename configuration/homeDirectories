# Global homeDirectories file.
# May be augmented with .homedirectories file in local directory.
# On UNIX may also be augmented with ~/.homedirectories file.
# Search order by pathhandler is
#  1. local .homedirectories file
#  2. [UNIX]: ~/.homedirectories file
#  3. BETALIB/configuration/homeDirectories file

# Aliases for BETALIB. Needed by the pathhandler to convert
# full paths back to '~beta' relative paths.
# Some system calls may report the current working directory
# differently, thus the need for aliases.
