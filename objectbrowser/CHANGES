Changed the following filenames:

Added bringBack facility to all moveables, such that a moveable will
move to the back, if you click on it's titlebar, while it is on the
top of all other moveables.  Else it will move to the top of the
others, as before.

The new grammar initialization code is called (betaGrammarInit)


Thu Nov 14 10:07:42 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed betagrammarinit to setup grammarTable.beta[].


Tue Nov 12 12:13:23 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Continued the chages from Nov 11 in private/objectviewbody.bet such
that objectbrowser now is robust towards damaged origin references (or
more correct: origin references with damaged prototypes).  Should in
general make objectbrowser more robust for all objects with damaged
prototype informations, but have not been tested.
   In the case of a damaged prototype etc., an empty LOW LEVEL object
view is shown.

Mon Nov 11 14:03:18 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed in private/objectviewbody.bet such that no object view is
opened in the case where root[]=NONE - usually due to outdated
fragment group file, or serious problems in the object prototype.
