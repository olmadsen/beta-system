M UI/evaluatormoveable.bet
M UI/objectview.bet

Corrected bug in order to be able to open an evaluator for all objects

Wed Apr 29 12:13:10 MET DST 1998: /roen
---------------------------------------

Changed the following files for opening the objectbrowser for expanded
(new) graphical representation of objectview.

windowedbrowser.bet:

Added virtual at top level for specifying which type of objectview should
be used. Also modified "showObject" to use this virtual when opening a new
objectview

UI/objectview.bet:

Added virtual declaration of "moveableObjectViewType"

UI/private/objectviewbody.bet:

The "doopen" pattern in the fragment "--openMoveableObjectView: Descriptor--" 
now uses the "moveableObjectViewType".

Also altered the file private/mpsinterfacebody.bet to handle realOpen
problems in fragmentgroups when using the objectbrowser together with the
compiler

Tue Jan 28 12:04:43 MET 1997: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed the following filenames:

    systemenvcoroutinespawner.bet      systemenvcompspawner.bet


Tue Dec  3 15:17:04 MET 1996/ jlk

Added bringBack facility to all moveables, such that a moveable will
move to the back, if you click on it's titlebar, while it is on the
top of all other moveables.  Else it will move to the top of the
others, as before.

Tue Nov 26 16:18:30 MET 1996

The new grammar initialization code is called (betaGrammarInit)


Thu Nov 14 10:07:42 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed betagrammarinit to setup grammarTable.beta[].


Tue Nov 12 12:13:23 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Continued the chages from Nov 11 in private/objectviewbody.bet such
that objectbrowser now is robust towards damaged origin references (or
more correct: origin references with damaged prototypes).  Should in
general make objectbrowser more robust for all objects with damaged
prototype informations, but have not been tested.
   In the case of a damaged prototype etc., an empty LOW LEVEL object
view is shown.

Mon Nov 11 14:03:18 MET 1996: /jlk
----------------------------------

Changed in private/objectviewbody.bet such that no object view is
opened in the case where root[]=NONE - usually due to outdated
fragment group file, or serious problems in the object prototype.
