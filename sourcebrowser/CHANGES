June 25, 1996:

Added the possibility to hide text files in projects (new menu item in
the 'Projects' menu).  (txt) files are therefore not shown by default
any longer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 24, 1996:

Corrected yet another error in identifying which files are (txt)
files.

Added 'reparse' menu item in Parse Error Window.

Committed changes below.

Changed:
  >Is now installing busyCursor on infoView.msgPush, and removes it on
  >infoView.msgPop
from May 27, since this implementation gave rise to problems for other
tool-integrators.
   Now the perations state.busy and state.normal are used to implement
having busyCursor while executing lloonngg operations in ymer.  These
operations are now inserted the proper places in the ymer source code.
State implements a stack of cursors, such that the proper cursor is
re-installed at the state.normal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 18, 1996:

Specifies now the window size explicitly.

Corrected error in scanextent/domain when the fragment is empty.

Corrected error in setting up isDirectory projects with executables -
were considered (txt) files :-(

----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 27, 1996:

locationView now keeps track of the info messages.  To be
used for displaying the entire message history on zooming of
locationView (by doubleclick, as described below).

Is now installing busyCursor on infoView.msgPush, and removes it on
infoView.msgPop

Integreted a new pane pattern (based on guienv/v1.3.1/utils/pane.bet).
This new pane allows zooming of members in a pane to take over the
entire pane space.  This new pane pattern is now in use in
sourcebrowser in its panes (and workspace window).

Based on this new pane, double-click in the label areas now makes the
pane member take over the entire pane area.

Added $Revision: 1.3 $ CVS keyword to anable autonatis update of the
revision number in the ymerVersion printout (see below).

Updated to the official v1.1 version by CVS merging these changes into
the development version (based on v1.0.2).  A few merge conflicts were
manually settled.
