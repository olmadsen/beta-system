Made changes to make loading of '.pjt' files more effecient.  Especially,
avoiding loading them before it is needed (i.e. when they become selected).

Added a few 'bringToFront' to solve the problem on NTI that
shift-doubleclicked windows were opened behind the originating browser.
However, these changes did not solve the problem.

Fri Jul 18 13:48:11 MET DST 1997
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed ymerBody such that '..' project now should work platform
independent (there were a problem on mac).  Also changed
depUtils/depGraph to use new scanIncludes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

'Close' menu item in the File menu is now only enabled when there are
more than one sep. browser opened (to avoid confusion between 'Close'
and Quit').

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added exception handling to all file.exists, file.readable, etc.

Michael Lassen:	Changed "uniqNames.bet" to make it work on Mac.

Problem: uniqName generates entries with both ':' and '/' in them.

Wed Feb 19 12:15:51 MET 1997
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected a bug in selectFragmentGroup that 'forgot' to test if the fg
did exist before attaching it to the project/group lists.

Thu Jan 23 11:51:41 MET 1997
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected a bug in private/mpsGraammarUtils.bet that gave a
'Configuration Error' when the MBSgrammarExt file is parsed (should
just be ignored as a normal situation.

Sat Jan 18 18:02:26 MET 199
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected bug in mpsGrammarUtils, that implied that Ymer went down
when the MBSgrammarsExt file does not exist.

Made changes to the browsers declaration, removing a virtual final
binding to another virtual.  As a result hereof, five (5) usages of
browsers.scan in ymerBody (and other files) had to be changes to use
explicit reference assignments to obtain the proper qualifications.
This change is done in order to try to avoid a strange Segmantation
Error, occuring nondeterministic when using Sif.

Tue Jan  7 15:44:30 MET 1997
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected bug in mpsGrammerUtil.bet that implied that selecting
project '..' in directory '/' would fail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 06 01:32:16 MET 1997

Corrected parseProjects, such that non-existing projects in the
project-files are not shown in the project-list pane.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 08:32:16 MET 1996

Corrected settings.bet such that projects.theProjects.clear is done
before reloading the ~/.ymer.pjt file.

Corrected ymerBody such that every separate browser loads the standard
projects from the ".pjt' files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 11:13:35 MET 1996

Ensured, that reparse in parseEditor saves the corrected file before
reparsing.

Corrected error in parseProjects.bet that made it impossble to define
projects containing groups.

Made all projects with subprojects appear as projectname/ (previous
some were named projectname/+)

Made scanextent and scandomain robust in the case of the new dep.graph
exceptions - previously not further bound, making ymer break down in
e.g. parseerrors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 26, 1996:

Committed changes below.

Removed the local implementation of fg.isRealOpen and now uses the
(hopefully) 'correct' mps.isRealOpen.

Committed changes below.

Updated doc/ymer.html (online manual).

Added two buttoms '<' and '>' to the manual viever in help window to
make it easy to move to next (last) and previous (first) section in
the chosen manual.  Using double-clicking for (first) and (last).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 25, 1996:

Added zooming support to the Help window, allowing the two panes to be
zoomed to fill the entire help window.

Committed changes below.

Added the possibility to hide text files in projects (new menu item in
the 'Projects' menu).  (txt) files are therefore not shown by default
any longer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 24, 1996:

Corrected yet another error in identifying which files are (txt)
files.

Added 'reparse' menu item in Parse Error Window.

Committed changes below.

Changed:
  >Is now installing busyCursor on infoView.msgPush, and removes it on
  >infoView.msgPop
from May 27, since this implementation gave rise to problems for other
tool-integrators.
   Now the operations state.busy and state.normal are used to
implement having busyCursor while executing lloonngg operations in
ymer.  These operations are now inserted the proper places in the ymer
source code.  State implements a stack of cursors, such that the
proper cursor is re-installed at the state.normal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 18, 1996:

Specifies now the window size explicitly.

Corrected error in scanextent/domain when the fragment is empty.

Corrected error in setting up isDirectory projects with executables -
were considered (txt) files :-(

----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 27, 1996:

locationView now keeps track of the info messages.  To be
used for displaying the entire message history on zooming of
locationView (by doubleclick, as described below).

Is now installing busyCursor on infoView.msgPush, and removes it on
infoView.msgPop

Integreted a new pane pattern (based on guienv/v1.3.1/utils/pane.bet).
This new pane allows zooming of members in a pane to take over the
entire pane space.  This new pane pattern is now in use in
sourcebrowser in its panes (and workspace window).

Based on this new pane, double-click in the label areas now makes the
pane member take over the entire pane area.

Added Revision CVS keyword to enable automatic update of the
revision number in the ymerVersion printout (see below).

Updated to the official v1.1 version by CVS merging these changes into
the development version (based on v1.0.2).  A few merge conflicts were
manually settled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 2, 1996:

Added
	browser.locationView.locked 
to make it possible to specify, that the file/group is write locked.
When changing write lock status for a file/group, execute:
	true->browser.locationView.locked
or	false->browser.locationView.locked
----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 1, 1996:

Added
	browser.locationView.checked 
to make it possible to specify, that the group have been checked
(or not checked).  When chancing checked status, execute:
	true->browser.locationView.checked
or	false->browser.locationView.checked
----------------------------------------------------------------------
April 30, 1996:

Changed location of infoView and locationView to:
	browser.infoView and browser.locationView
This will affect tool integrators of ymer !!!!

Added
	browser.locationView.changed 
to make it possible to specify, that the file/group have been changed
(or not changed).  Whan changing a file/group, execute:
	true->browser.locationView.changed
or	false->browser.locationView.changed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
April 29, 1996:

Added further support for reading .html files.  When opening the help
window, the following additional .html files will become available in
the Manuals menu:
	1) If there is a file with the same name as the current group,
	   but with extension .html
	2) If the current project is:
	    - a directory, and there are files with extension .html in
	      that directory
	    - a root/domain/extent project, and there exists a file
	      with same name as the project, but with extension .html.
	    - a project file, and there exists a file with same name
	      as the project file, but with extension .html.
All these .html files will become available in the help window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
April 24, 1996:

Added ymerVersion to contain textstring to be printed by tool
integrators to tell about the version of Ymer, they are using.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
April 23, 1996:

Changed location of cfe and cge to:
	browser.cfe and browser.cge
to make life easier for me :-)

This will affect tool integrators of ymer !!!!

Concluded first vorking version of the new internal organization
(started April 22).  It works now with very good increase in execution
speeds when moving between fragments (no need to re-prettyprint).

sourcebrowser.  Not complete yet.
