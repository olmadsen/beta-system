<BODY>
This short description describes the browser which is part of the
Mjølner BETA System.  This browser is used in a number of tools in the
system (Sif, Freja, Frigg, Valhalla).  This description only describes
the browser functionalities, and not the application specific
functionalities (such as the Sif Structure Editor functionalities).

<HR>

<H1>1. User Interface</H1>

We will here present the most important user interface components of
the source browser.  Tools integrated with the source browser will
share these user interface components.  These components are therefore
described here, such that the other tools need not describe these
components.  We will call applications and tools, which are integrated
with the source browser 'source browser applications'.
<P>
We will describe the windows, menus and other interaction
possibilities in the following sections.
<P>
The source browser interface consists of a number of different window
types:
<UL>
<LI>        - browser window
<LI>        - workspace window
<LI>        - separate code viewer window
<LI>        - subviewer window
<LI>        - parse editor window
<LI>        - two types of semantic errors windows
<LI>        - graphical dependency graph browser window
<LI>        - help window
</UL>
where the browser window is the main window, giving access to the main
browsing facilities and to the other windows.  These windows will be
described in the following.

<H2>1.1 Browser Window</H2>

The browser window appears like:
<pre>
       +-------------------------------------------------+
       | File | Project | View |     | History | Windows | (menu bar)
       +-------------------------------------------------+
       |                 |                |              |
       |                 |                |              |
       |                 |                |              |

       |                 |                |              |
       +-----------------+----------------+--------------+
       |                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       |                     (4)                         |
       |                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       +-------------------------------------------------+
       | (5)                                             |
       | (6)                                             |
       +-------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
where
<UL>
<LI>        (1) is a list of 'projects'. It is called the project list
            pane 
<LI>        (2) is a list of fragments in the 'project' that is
            selected in the project list pane.  It is called the
            fragment group list pane or just group list pane
<LI>        (3) is a list of properties and fragment forms in the
            fragment that is selected in the group list pane.  It is
            called the fragment group viewer or just group
            viewer  
<LI>        (4) displays the BETA code of the fragment for that is
            selected in the group view.  It is called the
            fragment form viewer or just form viewer.  Since
            this pane contains the actual source code, it will also be
            called the code viewer.  The code viewer will be
            seen in many different windows and the functionality of
            the code viewer is described later
<LI>        (5) Displays the full path of the selected in the group
            list pane - or in the project list pane, if nothing is
            selected in the group list pane 
<LI>        (6) Displays information, such as no fragments in the
            selected project or what the source browser currently
            is doing, in the case of a long operation.
</UL>
The above mentioned viewers are in fact editors in some source browser
applications.  E.g. the code viewer will in some browser application
include structure editing functionality.  To make this explicit, we
will use the terms viewer and editor in the following way: viewer is
used, when describing the functionality common for all browser
applications, and editor is used when describing the editing
facilities.  E.g. the 'code viewer' will be called the 'code editor'
in manuals describing source browser applications with editing
facilities in the code viewer (as described in this manual).

<H3>1.1.1 Menus</H3>

The following sections describe the browser window menus offered by
the source browser. Specific source browser applications may supply
additional menus.  Please refer to the individual tool manuals for
information on which menus they supply for the browser window.

<H3>1.1.2 File menu</H3>
<pre>
        File
          Help
          Save settings
          Reset settings
          Close		Ctrl-w
          Quit		Ctrl-q
</pre>
'Help' displaces a window, containing a series of manuals.  The
different manuals can be selected in the 'Manuals' menu of this window.
<P>
'Save settings' enables you to save the current contents of the
project list pane on a project-file $USER/.ymer.pjt.  This project is
then automatically loaded next time you invoke a source browser
application - in this way you can save your configuration.  It also
saves/creates another file, $USER/.ymer.rc containing information on
the locations of the BETA compiler, and other tools in the TOOLS menu.
<P>
'Reset settings' enables you to clear the project list pane and reset
it to the last settings (or the default settings, if no
$USER/.ymer.[pjt|rc] files are found.
<P>
'Close' closes the window (and terminates the source browser
application, if this is the last browser window).
<P>
'Quit' closes all browser windows, and terminates the source browser
application.  In both 'Close' and 'Quit', the source browser will
examine if any files have been changed, and prompt for whether these
files should be saved before closing/quitting.

<H3>1.1.3 Project menu</H3>
<pre>
        Project
          New ...
          Open ...
          Reload
          Save
          Save As ...
          Rename ...
          Close
          Show Text Files
</pre>
'New ...' is an unimplemented menu-item (that is, it is
always disabled - will be implemented in a later version)
<P>
'Open ... opens a standard file dialog, and you can now select (a) a
project-file (must have extension .pjt), (b) a directory, and (c) a
.bet/.ast/.astL file.  You will then in the project list pane find a
project of the corresponding type A, B, or C.  All other selections
will be ignored.
<P>
'Reload' is used to reload the contents of this project (e.g. if this
project represents a directory, and the contents of this directory
have changed).
<P>
'Save' is yet another unimplemented menu-item (that is, it is always
disabled - will be implemented in a later version).  Is intended to
enable the saving of changes to a project-file project.
<P>
'Save As ...' is yet another unimplemented menu-item (that is, it is
always disabled - will be implemented in a later version).  Is
intended to enable saving an existing project under a new name (and
location).
<P>
'Rename ...' displays a dialog in which you can type a new name for
the selected project.
<P>
'Close' closes the selected project, and removes it from the project
list pane.
<P>
'Show Text Files' is a toggle menu.  If 'on', text files in the
current project will be shown in the group view.  If 'off', only
source code files will be shown in the group view.  Default this
menuitem is 'off'.

<H3>1.1.4 View menu</H3>
<pre>
        View
          Abstract (Dbl-Clk)	
          Abstract Recursively
          Overview			Ctrl-o
          Detail (Dbl-Clk)		Ctrl-d
          Detail Recursively
          Search			Ctrl-s
          Replace			Ctrl-r
	  Follow Semantic Link (Dbl-Clk)
	  Follow Link to Fragment (Dbl-Clk)
	  Follow Link to SLOT
          Zoom in			Ctrl-1
          Zoom out			Ctrl-2
          Zoom to Full Editor		Ctrl-3
          Reprettyprint			Ctrl-p
          Show AST Dump
</pre>          

One important quality of the source browser is the possibility to
present documents at different abstraction levels. Abstract
presentation gives a good overview over a document by suppressing
irrelevant details. 
<P>
Abstract presentation is provided by means of contractions. A
contraction is a special presentation of an sub-AST, where only the
root is presented.  If the construct has an associated comment, the
comment marker is included in the contraction. Browsing in the
document can be done by detailing, i.e. opening the contractions
selectively. This is done either by the command Detail or by
double-clicking. Abstract presentation can be used to produce
documentation such as a interface specifications by saving the
document on textual form at different abstraction levels, using the
Save Abstract... command.
<P>
'Abstract' contracts the current selection, i.e. presents the current
selection as a contraction instead of the full "text".
<P>
'Abstract Recursively' traverses the current selection recursively and
contracts those constructs that have a certain syntactic
category. This command has only effect if abstraction levels have been
specified in the grammar for the particular language. The grammar may
specify a list of syntactic categories that automatically shall be
contracted. For BETA, the syntactic categories are 'ObjectDescriptor',
'Attributes', and 'Imperatives'.
<P>
'Overview' behaves like 'Abstract Recursively' but the current
selection is reestablished after the 'Abstract Recursively' command,
i.e. the path from the root to the current selection is detailed. This
command is useful if you wants to see the context of the current
selection.
<P>
'Detail' - If the current selection is a contraction, this operation
opens the contraction, i.e.  presents the next level of text. A
contraction can also be opened by double-clicking on it. If the
current selection is not a contraction any visible contraction in the
current selection will be opened.
<P>
'Detail Recursively' recursively details the contractions in the
current selection.
<P>
'Search...' makes it possible to search for a substring of a lexem,
i.e. a name definition, a name application or a string the current
fragment form.  A dialog pops up.
<P>
'Replace...' extends the search dialog with a replace text field.
<P>
'Follow Semantic Link' - During the checking phase a number of
semantic links are inserted in the AST. These links are available to
the user. Using this command on a name application the semantic link
will be followed and the current selection is changed to the
appropriate node in the current or another fragment form.
<P>
'Follow Link to Fragment' - Given a SLOT definition, a binding of the
definition (i.e. a fragment form with the same name and type) can be
searched. This is done by selecting the SLOT definition and using this
command. The code viewer will now search for a fragment form with the
same name in the BODY and MDBODY hierarchy of the group that this
fragment is part of. Notice that the binding of Attributes SLOTs may
only be found in this way if they are bound in the BODY and MDBODY
hierarchy.
<P>
'Follow Link to SLOT' - The code viewer searches after a SLOT
definition with the same name as the selected item along the ORIGIN
chain until it finds it or reaches the top, i.e. betaenv.  See SLOT
Searching.
<P>
'Zoom In' - Changes the contents of the code viewer to the current
selection, i.e. the root of the AST shown in the code viewer is
changed to the sub-AST, that corresponds to the current selection
<P>
'Zoom Out' - Extends the contents of the code viewer to show one level
more of the structure, i.e.  the viewer root is changed to its father
<P>
'Zoom To Full Editor' - Extends the contents of the code viewer to
show the whole fragment form, i.e.  the viewer root is set to the
whole AST of the fragment form.
<P>
'Reprettyprint' rebuilds the textual presentation of the AST and
reestablishes the current selection.  This command can be used if the
contents of the code viewer needs to be refreshed.
<P>
'Show AST Dump' - This command is useful for users of the
metaprogramming system. It prints in the console window a dump of the
sub-AST that corresponds to the current selection

<H4>1.1.4.1 Following  links to other fragment forms</H4>

If the destination fragment form is different from the source fragment
form, the destination fragment form is shown in the same code viewer
or in a separate code viewer, depending on the code viewer of the
source fragment form. If the code viewer of the source fragment form
is:
<UL>
<LI>        * part of the browser window, the contents of the code
          viewer window is changed
<LI>        * a separate code viewer, the contents of the code viewer
          window is changed  
<LI>        * a subviewer, a new subviewer is opened
<LI>        * part of a workspace window, a new code viewer is
          inserted in the workspace window. 
</UL>
<H3>1.1.5 History menu</H3>
<pre>
        History
          Back		Ctrl-b
          Forward	Ctrl-f
          (variable contents)
</pre>
'Back' and 'Forward' moves you along the path you have previously
examined.
<P>
Furthermore, this menu contains one entry for each fragment form, you
have displayed in the code viewer.  This is used for speedy access to
previously visited fragment forms.

<H3>1.1.6 Windows menu</H3>
<pre>
        Windows
          Open Workspace
          Open Separate Browser
          Open Dependency Graph Browser
          Open Separate Code Viewer
          Open Semantic Errors Viewer
          Open Semantic Errors Editor
          (variable contents)
</pre>
'Open workspace' opens a workspace window (see later more on this).
<P>
'Open Separate Browser' opens a new browser window, identical to
this one.  This window is controlled by the same source browser
application.  Makes it possible to browse two different 'places' at
once.
<P>
'Open Dependency Graph Browser' opens a graphical browser window.
This graphical browser initially contains one element, representing
the currently selected fragment group in the group view.  You can here
browse the dependency graph of this fragment group.
<P>
'Open Separate Code Viewer' opens a separate window just like the code
viewer, displaying the currently selected fragment form in the group
viewer.  It enables focussing on one fragment form, while browsing
other fragment forms.
<P>
'Open Semantic Errors Viewer' will open a semantic errors viewer on the
selected group, if there are any semantic errors in that group.  See
later for more information on the semantic errors editor.
<P>
'Open Semantic Errors Editor' will open a semantic errors editor on the
selected group, if there are any semantic errors in that group.  See
later for more information on the semantic errors editor.
<P>
The rest of the menu contains one entry for each window opened by the
source browser.  Selecting one of these items will bring the window to
the front (and wriggle it)

<H3>1.1.7 Double-click</H3>

As already mentioned, you can display a fragment form in the code
viewer by selecting it in the group viewer.  But that's not all you
can do in the group viewer.
<P>
Double-click can is used heavily in the source browser for browsing.
<P>
If you double-click on an ORIGIN, INCLUDE, BODY or MDBODY property, in
the group viewer, the fragment group referred to in the property will
be included in the group list pane and selected there.
<P>
If you double-click on a MAKE property, a new window appear with a
Lidskjalv text editor for editing the MAKE file.
<P>
In the code viewer, double-click is also used for
browsing. Double-clicking on the current selection will perform
different actions. If the current selection is
<UL>
<LI>        * a name application, the semantic link will be followed (if
          available) if the definition is located in another fragment
          form the contents of the code viewer will be changed to
          show that fragment form.
<LI>        * a SLOT definition, the fragment link will be followed
          (if available) and the destination fragment form will be
          shown in the same code viewer
<LI>        * a comment mark (*), the full comment will be shown
          instead 
<LI>        * a expanded comment (* ... *), the comment mark will be
          shown instead 
<LI>        * anything else the current selection will be contracted
          (...) 
</UL>
<H3>1.1.8 Shift-double-click</H3>

Shift-double-click is used for browsing like double-click, except that
separate windows are opened.
<P>
In the project list pane, the group list pane and the group viewer,
you can open a separate window by pressing &lt;shift&gt; down while
double-clicking on an element in one of the lists.
<P>
In the project list pane, you will get a new separate browser window,
with the subprojects of this project as top-level projects.
<P>
In the group list pane, you will get a new separate browser window
with the [domain] and [extent] projects as top-level projects (See
Project Definitions).
<P>
In the group viewer, you will get a separate code viewer on the
selected fragment form.  If the currently selected element in the
group viewer is not a fragment form (i.e. it is a property), the
effect is different.  If the selected is an ORIGIN, INCLUDE; BODY or
MDBODY property, a new separate browser window with the specified
fragment group as top-level project.  If the selected is a MAKE
property, a text editor is opened, enabling textual editing of the
Make file specified.  All other properties are ignored.
<P>
In the code viewer, shift double-click will do the same as
double-click (except that the "result" will be presented in a separate
window. Shift double-click will open different kind of separate
windows depending on the current selection. If the current selection
is:
<UL>
<LI>        * a name application, the semantic link will be followed
          (if available) and the destination fragment form will be
          shown in a separate code viewer 
<LI>        * a SLOT definition, the fragment link will be followed
          (if available) and the destination fragment form will be
          shown in a separate code viewer
<LI>        * a comment, the comment will be shown in a separate
          window 
<LI>        * anything else a subviewer window with the current
          selection as its contents will be opened.
</UL>
<H3>1.1.9 Search Facilities</H3>

There is a search facility in the the 3 upper panes If you are having
keyboard focus in one of these panes - usually by just clicking inside
them, you can start search by pressing <Ctrl>i (^i for short - "i" is
for "interactive search").  You can now type a string, and the source
browser will immediately select the first item in the list with the
typed string somewhere in the name.
<P>
You can get the next fragment form, matching the string, by again
pressing ^i.  Repeated ^i will repeatedly find the next match,
starting from the top of the list again, if no more matches are found.
<P>
You can stop the search by pressing &lt;cr&gt;.
<P>
If you start the string by a "^" (caret), the string _must_ be a
prefix string, i.e. the name _must_ start with the string.


<H3>1.1.10 Changing the size of the different inner panes</H3>

If you position the cursor between any of the panes (1)-(4), a
cross-cursor appears.  By pressing the mouse button you can move the
separation between the panes, making more space for the one (and
naturally consequently less for the other).


<H3>1.1.11 Zooming the different inner panes</H3>

If you position the cursor at the visible borders of the panes (1)-(5)
and double-click, you can make the particular pane zoom.  Panes
(1)-(3) zooms to cover the other panes (1)-(3), whereas pane (4) and
(5) zooms to take over the entire browser window.
<P>
As an extra benefit of zooming, pane (5) will in zoomed state display
a view of all messages that have been written in pane (6).


<H3>1.1.12 Information in pane (5)</H3>

Pane (5) shows the file-system location of the current fragment
group.  In addition, there may be state information visible at the
left side of pane (5).  There are three types of state information:
<UL>
<LI>        '%' indicates that the current fragment group is locked
                (cannot be edited)
<LI>        '*' indicates that the current fragment group have been
                changed 
<LI>        'c' indicates that the current fragment group have been
                checked by a semantic checker, such that semantic
                information is vailable for semantic browsing.
</UL>

<HR>

<H2>1.2 Workspace Window</H2>

A workspace window (you can create as many as you want) is a window in
which you can view (and possibly edit) fragment forms from different
fragment groups (or the same fragment group) together.
The workspace window looks like:
<pre>
        +---------------------------------------+
        | File | View | Import | Scroll | Close | (menu bar)
        +---------------------------------------+
        |                                       |
        |            (7)                        |
        |                                       |
        +---------------------------------------+
</pre>
(7) is an outer scroller, which initially is empty.
<P>
When a fragment form have been imported to the workspace through the
'Import' menu, it will be made visible in a view identical to the code
viewer in browser window.  The workspace may contain as many such
views as you wish. The outer scroller enables you to scroll among the
fragment forms in the workspace (try it - it is difficult to describe
short).
<P>
As in the browser window, you can place the cursor between two views
in the outer scroller, and thereby make the one smaller and the other
bigger.  But in the workspace you can even more.  If you press down
&lt;shift&gt; while pressing the mouse button, you will _only_ resize
the view _above_ the cursor - this is handy for making one view bigger
without affecting the other views.
<P>
As in the browser window, you can also zoom the panes by
double-clicking at the frames surrounding the individual panes.  A
zoomed pane will take over the entire workspace window.

<H3>1.2.1 Menus</H3>

The above menus are those supplied by the source browser by default in
a workspace window.  Specific source browser applications may define
additional workspace window menus - please refer to those manuals for
details.

<H3>1.2.2 File Menu</H3>

The 'File' menu just contains a 'Close Ctrl-w' entry to enable closing
the workspace.

<H3>1.2.3 View Menu</H3>

The 'View' menu is identical to the 'View' menu in the browser window.

<H3>1.2.4 Import Menu</H3>

The 'Import' menu will always contain at least one entry.  This entry
is the name of the name of the currently selected fragment group in
the group list pane in the browser window.  If selected, all fragment
forms in that fragment group will be displayed in the workspace.
Following this permanent entry, a variable number of entries are
shown.  Each entry corresponds to one fragment form in the currently
selected fragment group in the group list pane in the browser window.
If you select one of these entries, the corresponding fragment form
will be displayed in the workspace.

<H3>1.2.5 Scroll Menu</H3>

The 'Scroll' menu will contain one item for each fragment form in the
workspace.  If selected, the scroller will scroll such that the
fragment form view is visible.

<HR>

<H2>1.5 Parse Errors Editor Window</H2>

If you select a fragment group that haven't been parsed (i.e. no
.ast[L] file exist, or it's outdated), a prompt will ask you if this
should be done.  If you say yes, the source file will be parsed.
<P>
If the source file may contain parse errors, a parse errors editor
window is automatically displayed.  It looks the following:
<pre>
        +-------------+
        | File | Edit |
        +------+------+

        |             |
        +-------------+
</pre>
The upper pane will display the list of parse errors, with the
first one selected.
<P>
The lower pane will contain the source file, with the line with
the first parse error selected.
<P>
If you press &lt;cr&gt; in the upper pane, the next parse error is
selected in the upper pane, and the corresponding line displayed in
the lower pane.
<P>
As in the browser window, you can place the cursor between the two
panes, and thereby make the one smaller and the other
bigger.

<H3>1.5.1 Menus</H3>

The above menus are those supplied by the source browser by default in
a parse errors editor window.  Specific source browser applications
may define additional parse errors editor window menus - please refer

the specific source browser application.
<P>
Selecting one of the entries will load the corresponding manual into
the upper pane.
<H4>1.8.2.1 HTML support</H3>
The Help window also offers support for reading HTML files in
general.  This is done by dunamically including the following
'manuals' in the 'Manuals' menu:
<UL>
<LI>	1) If there is a file with the same name as the current group,
	   but with extension .html
<LI>	2) If the current project is:
<UL>
<LI>	    - a directory, and there are files with extension .html in
	      that directory
<LI>	    - a root/domain/extent project, and there exists a file
	      with same name as the project, but with extension .html.
<LI>	    - a project file, and there exists a file with same name
	      as the project file, but with extension .html.
</UL>
</UL>
All these .html files will become available in 'Manuals' menu of the
Help window.

<H1>2. Project definition</H1>

A project is either:
<UL>
<LI>        A. Defined in a 'project-file' (more later)
<LI>        B. A directory
<LI>        C. A fragment group
</UL>
A project may contain subprojects.  These are defined differently for
the three project types:
<UL>
<LI>        A. A project may have defined subprojects in the project-file.
<LI>        B. The sub-directories are considered subprojects.
<LI>        C. Two subprojects are defined: [domain] and [extent].  These
           subprojects contain the fragment forms in the
           dependency-graph of the fragment group.  [domain] contains
           all those in the domain (that is excluding BODY fragments),
           and [extent] contains all those in the extent (that is
           including BODY fragments). These two subprojects have in
           turn defined subprojects, namely the fragment groups in the
           domain (resp. the extent), sorted out into the libraries
           they are part of (e.g. basiclib, process, etc).
</UL>
<H2>2.1 Standard projects</H2>

Assuming that you have not used any source browser applications
before, the project list pane will display three projects at start-up:
"Std. Libraries", "~/" and "./".
<P>
"Std. Libraries" is a predefined project (defined in a project-file
located in ~beta/configuration/r3.0/ymer.pjt), containing all the
libraries in the standard MBS system (basiclib, containers, etc.)
<P>
"~/" is a directory project, referring to your home directory.
<P>
"./" is a directory project, referring to the current directory
(i.e. the directory, where you invoked the source browser application
from).
<P>
When a project/directory is selected in the project list pane, the
group list pane will display all fragment files in that project.  the
source browser remembers the last selection in the group list pane and
the group viewer, such that it will reestablish these selections next
time you enters the same project or group.
<P>
When a group is selected for the first time, the first fragment form
will automatically be selected.

<H2>2.2 Fold/unfold projects</H2>

To see the subprojects/subdirectories of a project, double-click on
the project (called unfold the project), then you will see the
subprojects, properly indented, e.g.:
<pre>
        Std. Libraries
          basiclib
          containers
          bifrost
          (etc.)
</pre>
Double-clicking again on the "Std. Libraries" will 'fold' the
subprojects, only showing the "Std. Libraries" project, and not the
subprojects.

<H2>2.3 Making a fragment group into a project</H2>

You can make a fragment group into a project by double-clicking on it
in the group list pane.  It will then appear in the project list pane
as a fragment group project.  Double-clicking on it in the project
list pane will calculate the dependency graph, and show the [domain]
and [extent] subprojects.

<HR>

<H2>2.4 Domain and Extent projects</H2>

When selecting the [domain] or [extent] subprojects, the source
browser will try to find possible conflicts in versions of libraries
used, and report such conflicts in a pop-up window.  The conflict
analysis is based on the assumption, that versions are identified by
subdirectory names of the form "vn.m", where 'n' i the major version
number, and 'm' is the minor version number.
