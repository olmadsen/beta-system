<h1>KNOWN INCONVENIENCES:</h1>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not possible to resize the panels in the help-window (reason
currently unknown).  You can resize the help-window, and the panes
will then resize accordingly.

---

The sizes of the panes in the browser-window are not correctly
calculated - giving a little waste of space in the window.

<h1>BUGS:</h1>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not possible to open programs, written in other languages, but
BETA (will be possible in a future release).  Selecting a file, which
does not sontain BETA code, may make the browser go down :-(
