(* This fragment is an attempt to assemble af compiler for MAC OS X on Intel
 * This should be possible by combining fragmenst for Intel code generation
 * and MACH-O object file format.
 * Intel code gen is used by Windows and Linux compilers and
 * MACH-O is used by the MAC PPC compiler.
 * It is probably OLM that started on this, but it s not compelete
 * '../MAC_IX86/MACOSXasmlink'; is a copy of MACOSX/MACOSXasmlink, but apparently 
 * some slots are missing - they have been added (but as empty)
 * Also, some MAC-O files are PPC dependent
 * Latest attempt: 2016/11
