Status for new backend pr 15.1.01
---------------------------------

All of tst*.bet can be compiled, linked and run, but some files still
have errors.

3.	save/restore of busy-registers at call places;
	for sparc floating point registers must be saved;
	see backErr3.bet

4.	Allocation of specific physical registers;
	sometimes it is necessary to be able to allocate/control
	explicit physical registers:
4.1	For external calls the return value is often in a specific
	register like %o0 - %eax for INTEL
4.2	For floating point on sparc: %f0
4.3	For COM calls the input arguments are in
	    %i0, %i1, %i2, ...
4.4	Similar for callBack - here a trick has been used
	to get the input values from the registers

6.	COM support
	'tstcom' and 'tstholder'  can compile, but fail to execute;
	One problem is that the G-part and M-part MUST come
	after each other, i.e. G-part and then M-part.
	Perhaps this should be fixed at the SYNTHESIZER level.
	An attempt has been made to fic this in SYNTHESIZER/dobody.
	There is a problme with backend:pushadr - IS WRONG, but
	some use of it must be fixed.

7.	Constant arguments
	In some places (arithShiftLeft) we need to check the size
	of a constant argument.

8.	Use of address registers must be checked for GC-problems.
	As of now some address resgisers (at least for repetitions)
	may point into objects.

9.	Index-check is NOT complete - reconsider interface!

10.	In intReg2float we use %f0 because there seems to be problems with
	writeReg2

OBS! All backend switches have been assigned new numbers, since some
of the numbers were used by other parts of the compiler.
