Status for new backend pr 14.2.01
---------------------------------

Currently no know errors on sun4s.

To be fixed:

2.	Register spilling. When more registers are needed than there
	are physical registers, registers must be save/restored on the stack.
2.1	Compute total size of adrReg,dataReg,externalParamArea
	for allocation of tmp-stack-space
2.2	Implement spilling algorithm
2.3	Test spilling on sun4s 
2.4	...???

3.	Allocation of specific physical registers;
	sometimes it is necessary to be able to allocate/control
	explicit physical registers:
3.1	For external calls the return value is often in a specific
	register like %o0 - %eax for INTEL
3.2	For floating point on sparc: %f0
3.3	For COM calls the input arguments are in
	    %i0, %i1, %i2, ...
3.4	Similar for callBack - here a trick has been used
	to get the input values from the registers

4.	Index-check is NOT complete - reconsider interface!

5.	%i2,%i3,%i4 are always cleared at G- and M-entrypoints.
	This should be handled by INTERMEDIATEmachine.
	FG has fixed this - but call of AlloI must be checked

6.	In asgRef, the dest-register is cleared in order not to confuse GC.
	Must be handled in a better way.

7.	Constant arguments
	In some places (arithShiftLeft) we need to check the size
	of a constant argument.

8.	In intReg2float we use %f0 because there seems to be problems with
	writeReg2

9.	Check with FG & AE why we changed syntlibbody:goorigin to
		   (if common.switch[121] then
                       reg1.alloc;
                       (A2[],reg1[])->mch.ldVal;
                       A2.reg.deAlloc;
                       reg1 -> A2.reg
                    else
                       (A2[],reg1[])->mch.ldVal;
                   if)
	Aha! Probably to make more efficient use of registers.
	But it gives errors for origin bind tables. In bind tables
	we should use %o0, since an allocated register may be in use
	at the call site.

OBS! All backend switches have been assigned new numbers, since some
of the numbers were used by other parts of the compiler.
