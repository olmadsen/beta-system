These are the files used for testing BETA.
The organizarion is:

.	 contains the files used by the 'tst' program
tstdump	 contains the files used to test beta.dump
misc	 contains other files, that either
	 1) cannot be built into tst.bet, e.g. tstqua, and tstgc,  or
	 2) test specific stuff, and should be (but has not yet been) 
            included in tst.bet.

These files are under CVS.
Simple use:

a) setenv CVSROOT /users/beta/.CVSHOME

b) To check out the entire TST the first time:
     cvs get TST

c) To check out changes made by other people (in other check-outs):
     cvs update

d) To make your local changes available to others:
     cvscom 
   or
     cvs commit
   'cvscom' is preferred, because it list differences to you before
   you check them in.

e) To add a new file under CVS, and make it available to other:
     cvs add <myfile>
     cvs commit
