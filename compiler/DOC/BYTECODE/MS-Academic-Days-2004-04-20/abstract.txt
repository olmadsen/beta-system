BETA is an object-oriented programming language from the Scandinavian
school of object-orientation starting with the Simula
languages. Simula was developed at the Norwegian Computing Center,
Oslo, in the 1960s. One of the original designers of Simula, the late
professor Kristen Nygaard, University of Oslo, was a co-designer of
BETA together with Bent Bruun Kristensen, Ole Lehrmann Madsen and
Birger Møller-Pedersen.
 
BETA is among others characterized by powerful abstraction
mechanisms. This includes the pattern concept, which a.o. unifies
class and method. The notion of virtual pattern generalizes virtual
procedure (method) and provides a virtual class concept that supports
generic classes.

Native compilers for BETA exist for a number of platforms, including:
Macintosh, Apollo, Hewlett-Packard, SUN Sparc, Linux, and
Windows. Recently work has been going on to port BETA to the bytecode
based platforms of SUN Java and Microsoft .NET.
 
This talk will demonstrate some of the issues involved in making a
"nice" mapping of BETA to the CLR of .NET. The talk will illustrate
some of the benefits of working in a multi-language environment like
.NET, but will also try to illustrate some of the challenges one is
confronted with, when trying to port an existing language to the
common language runtime platform. The talk will conclude by outlining
our plans to continue the work in the context of ROTOR/sscli.

BETA is described in detail in the book "Object-Oriented Programming
in the BETA Programming Language" by Ole Lehrmann Madsen, Birger
Møller-Pedersen, Kristen Nygaard, Addison-Wesley, June 1993, ISBN
