The object-oriented programming language BETA evolved out of an early
scandinavian research project called the Mjølner Project in the mid
1970s. 

BETA was designed as a successor to the Simula languages developed at the
Norwegian Computing Center, Oslo, in the 1960s. One of the original
designers of Simula, Professor Kristen Nygaard, was co-designer of
BETA and participated in the development of BETA until his dead in
2002.

BETA is described in detail in e.g. the book "Object-Oriented
Programming in the BETA Programming Language" by Ole Lehrmann Madsen,
Birger Møller-Pedersen, Kristen Nygaard, Addison-Wesley, June 1993,
ISBN 0-201-62430-3.

BETA has been implemented for a number of platforms over the years -
Macintosh, Apollo, Hewlett-Packard, SUN Sparc, Linux, Windows.
Recently work has been going on to port BETA to the bytecode based
platforms of SUN Java and Microsoft .NET.

This talk will demonstrate some of the issues involved in making a
"nice" mapping of BETA to the CLR of .NET. The talk will illustrate
some of the benefits of working in a multi-language environment like
.NET, but will also try to illustrate some of the challenges you are
confronted with, when trying to port your existing language to the
common language runtime platform.

The computer Science Department was recently given a grant by
Microsoft to continue the work in the context of ROTOR/sscli.
The talk will conclude by outlining our plans for this work.
