<h1>Object-Oriented Language Interoperability</h1>

This page will eventually describe the Object-Oriented Language
Interoperability with .NET and Java, which is currently being implemented for the BETA
programming language.

<DT><B>[2005-09-05]</B>
<DD>We have made a new <A HREF="download/BETA_OOLI-2005-09-05.zip">release</A>! 
Since the previously published release we have fixed a number of
errors in the generated code and implemented a number of the basic
library functionalities - specifically the features needed to give
birth to a bootstrapped compiler.<BR>
The release now includes the <I>managed nbeta</I> which runs on both
.NET and ROTOR/SSCLI (although slow). See the included
README.{txt/html} file(s) for details on how to try the managed compiler.


<DT><B>[2004-05-12]</B>
<DD>We have made a new <A HREF="download/BETA_OOLI-2004-05-12.zip">release</A>! <BR>
This new release mainly deals with ROTOR: The compiler now detects if
it is running under ROTOR and will generate a script that invokes the
<CODE>clix</CODE> launcher for the generated .NET
executable. Furthermore some errors that prevented some programs from
working under ROTOR have been fixed. Finally the documentation has
been slightly improved, and some presentations we have given are now
included here.

<DT><B>[2004-03-24]</B>
<DD>We have received a grant from the 
<A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/Collaboration/University/Europe/RFP/Rotor2/">
second ROTOR RFP
</A>, 
thus the forthcoming work will focus on the ROTOR platform.
