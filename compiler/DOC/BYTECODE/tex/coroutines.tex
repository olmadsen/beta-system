\section{Coroutines, concurrency and synchronization}
BETA has semi-coroutines in the style of Simula. BETA coroutines may be
executed in the usual non-premptive way as known form Simula but
also in concurrency with preemptive scheduling.  For synchronization
of concurrent coroutines, a {\tt Semaphore} pattern is avaliable to
express synchronization at the basic level. The BETA mechanism for
coroutines, concurrency and synchronization are at a much more
primitive level than in CJ. However, the powerful abstraction
mechanisms of BETA makes it easy to build higher-level concurrency
mechanisms such as monitors and Ada-like rendezvous and the BETA
libraries include a number of such concurrency abstractions.
  
The basic coroutines can be implemented in CJ using Threads, but this
requires considerable overhead -- basically a coroutine shift is much
simpler than a thread shift. The coroutine implementation in CLR/JVM
is probably the part of BETA that does not map very well. Space does
not allow to give the details of the coroutine implementation, which
is heavily inspired by \cite{helsgaun}.
