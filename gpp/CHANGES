VERSION 2.1.2
=============
With v2.1.2 the following changes were introduced:


menubody.bet:
=============
toby 040396:	Errors corrected in 'Show Group Window' and 'Show Work Page'
		(checks if currentObject<>none and only changes page if
		different from current).

toby 290396:	'Show Attributes' checks if connector ends are <> none.

toby 180496:	Added debug entry to 'View' menu.

toby 100596:	In usages of 'checkAutoSaveFile' and 'recoverDiagFile'
		the new error exceptions is bound and the error is reported
		to the user.
		

diagrambody.bet:
================
toby 060396:	When removing last element on Work Sheet, page is closed
		after Group Window is made visible (instead of before).
		Changed because of problem with using 'Abstract' shortcut
		in this connection.
toby 100596:	Added binding of dump to title of 'Diagram' for debugging
		purposes.
		onRemove on titles sets references to possible
		DynamicItemConnectors, DynamicComponentConnectors and
		(Simple)PrefixConnectors connected to the title to none.
		(should fix sevaral (or all?) of the reported qua errors in
		ReferenceUserData). Also deletes AssociationNodes connected
		to title by AssociationConnectors and sets references to it
		to none. Of the same reason 'ListDiagramAbstract' no longer
		handles deletion og AssociationNodes. In 'ListDiagramAbstract'
		("prefix"-)wedges are now deleted after delete of the node
		so that the (Simple)prefixConnectors still exist when
		onRemove is called.

toby 080396:	updateDiagramNode tests and updates in case where
		AttributeDeclOpt was replaced by AttributeDeclOpt (calls
		nonterminalnode.redisplay).

toby 140396:	No output on console when selecting nodes with
		theSifEditor=none.

toby 290396:	'updateDiagramNode' incorporates case where the root of
		the fragmentform has been edited in Sif.

diagramattributes.bet:
======================
toby 080396:	Redisplay method added to nonterminalnodes.

toby 290396:	Initialization of pnode1 and pnode2 (userdata) changed
		for Prefix-/simple-prefixconnectors, so that userdata
		is initialized before asigning to pnode1 and pnode2.
		(wonder why it has ever worked before!!?).

toby 180496:	Console test-output removed from 'MakeUserDataLabelNode'.

gppinterfacebody.bet:
=====================
toby 080396:	In checkDiagFile it is checked if .freja file is readable.
		astReplaced calls updateDiagramNode if unExpanded replaced
		unExpanded.

toby 140396:	onInit on connectors used in 'Relations' menu checks if ends
		are none (means other function was selected).

toby 290396:	Switchmode has been reestablished in 'doStartup'.

toby 180496:	'ASTToNode' searches directly in localNodes in
		'patternDiagrams.theList' instead of in IndexIDList
		due to unresolved problems with saving IndexIDList.
		IndexIDList no longer kept up to date, so
		'AstToNodeListUpdate' just returns relevant node.
		NOTICE: No longer using IndexIDList should also work
		with diagrams created by older versions!

toby 220496:	Corrected error in 'ASTToNode' and 'AstToNodeListUpdate'
		that made 'New Program'/'New Library' loop indefinitely.
		All possible exceptions on mps.top.open in
		'OpenFragmentGroup' bound to prevent termination.

toby 100596:	'fragmentChanged' checks if FragmentDiagram was found
		before trying to adjust sizes (should realy no longer
		be necessary since Sif now only sends event if fragment
		is open in Freja).
		'astReplaced' considers case where a single declaration
		in a descriptor is deleted (does not as expected generate
		a 'listElementsDeleted' event, but the declaration is
		replaced by en optional).
		In usages of 'checkAutoSaveFile' and 'recoverDiagFile'
		the new error exceptions is bound and the error is reported
		to the user.
		All usages of disc entry.rename binds error exception.
		For DynamicItemConnectors and DynamicComponentConnectors
		onDelete checks if one is a SimpleNode else it does nothing.

nonterminalnodebody.bet:
========================
toby 080396:	Added body for nonterminalnode's redisplay method.

fragmentnodebody.bet:
=====================
toby 140396:	Removed console output from AttributeNodeDetail.

toby 290396:	'theRoot' and 'astIndex' are updated in
		'FragmentNodeRedisplay'.

patterndiagrambody.bet:
=======================
toby 290396:	Initialization of pnode1 and pnode2 (userdata) changed
		for Prefix-/simple-prefixconnectors, so that userdata
		is initialized before asigning to pnode1 and pnode2.
		(wonder why it has ever worked before!!?).

toby 100596:	'dump' on PatternDiagramNodes starts with dumping connected
		connectors (debug. purp.).

gppinterface.bet:
=================
toby 180496:	Added debug entry to 'View' menu.

toby 100596:	Added binding of dump to title of 'Diagram' for debugging
		purposes.
		Added virtual 'error' exception to 'recoverDiagFile' and
		'checkAutoSaveFile' in case of any disk entry exceptions
		occuring in these.

abstractnodebody.bet:
=====================
toby 100596:	onRemove on DiagramNodes sets references to possible
		DynamicItemConnectors and DynamicComponentConnectors
		connected to the DiagramNode to none. (should fix
		sevaral (or all?) of the reported qua errors in
		ReferenceUserData).
