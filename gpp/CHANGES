VERSION 2.2
=============
With v2.2 the following changes were introduced:


gppinterface.bet:
=================
toby 280596:	Update to basiclib/v1.5.

toby 140696:	Added 'New Graphics Page', 'Load Graphics' and 'Save Page
		As Graphics' entries to File menu. This amongst others
		enables user to:

		 - Create graphics pages on which only graphics is
		   edited.
		 - Use Freja as a graphics only application.
		 - Load diagram into Freja as graphics only.
		 - Copy parts of diagrams to graphics pages to edit
		   them as graphics only.

		Object menu entries dealing with abstract/detail has
		been integrated with existing entries in View menu.
		Furthermore 'Abstract Recursively','Detail Recursively'
		and 'Overview' have also been implemented for pattern
		diagrams ('Detail on Different Page' still missing for
		pattern diagrams).

		Added entry to Page menu, so that pages can be hidden
		one by one - if all pages have been hidden, Page
		Structure Page will automatically popup to enable user
		to select page to be shown.
		Also added entry 'Show all Pages' to Page menu.

toby 150896:	Added 'promptForBoolean' virtual pattern ment for further
		binding in Freja.
		
		Hide/show Sif menu item moved to File menu.
		
		Open file dialog accepts filename is entered without
		extension.
		
		Added binding of 'ConcludeDisplay' in 'title' of 'Pattern-
		DeclDiagram'. Mainly to be used to implement manual placing
		of diagrams.
		
		New 'prettyprintSubPatterns' pattern that given a diagram
		will "prettyprint" the tree of sub-patterns. Uses new
		'treeprettyprint' library.
		
		New 'edgedSpecializations' pattern that given a diagram
		will make specialization connectors only follow horizontal
		and vertical lines.

		Hide/show Sif item moved to File menu.


menubody.bet:
=============
toby 280596:	Update to basiclib/v1.5.

toby 140696:	See gppinterface.bet.

toby 150896:	'openFile' pattern used everywhere .diag, .ast or .bet
		files are opened.
		
		Hide/show Sif item moved to File menu.

		All settings regarding layout are now controlled via
		a layout preferences dialog.

		Added 'Layout Sub-patterns' entry to View menu. prettyprints
		tree of sub-patterns of a diagram.

		Added 'Edged Specialization Connectors' entry to View menu.
		Makes specialization connectors of sub-patterns only follow
		horizontal and vertical lines.


diagrambody.bet:
================
toby 280596:	Update to basiclib/v1.5.

toby 140696:	Virtuals on titles implement recursive abstract/detail
		and overview functionality.

toby 150896:	Instead creating new prefixConnectors when e.g. a new
		'localNodes.last' is created 'SetEnds' is used to set
		new end-point of existing connector (preserves connector
		layout).

		'OADDisplay' prepared for manual positioning of diagrams.


diagramattributes.bet:
======================
toby 280596:	Update to basiclib/v1.5.

toby 140696:	Virtuals on AbstractNode implement recursive abstract/detail
		and overview functionality.

toby 150896:	Corrected 'DiagramList' so that it handles more than one
		fragmentform (instead of only index, index and name of
		fragmentform is stored).
		
		SetEnds bound in 'prefixConnector' and 'SimplePrefixCon-
		nector'.

		'InheritanceList' is now a 'Set'. All usages of it changed
		accordingly.

		Added 'getSubPatternDiagrams' pattern to 'InheritanceList'.


gppinterfacebody.bet:
=====================
toby 280596:	Update to basiclib/v1.5.

toby 140696:	Arbitrary number of pages can be saved (but still only

toby 150896:	Includes new 'treeprettyprint' library.

		'prettyptintSubPatterns' and 'edgeSpecializations'
		implementation.

		'openFile' pattern used everywhere .diag, .ast or .bet
		files are opened.

		'promptForBoolean' and 'alertUser' generally used instead
		of 'DSUIUserGetYesOrNo' and 'DSUIUserAckMessage'
		respectively.
