* The library raster_xpmfile supports reading Xpm files, by
  adding the following operation to bitmap:

     readFromXPMfile:
       (* Reads the contents of the XPMfile into THIS(bitmap) *)
       (# filename: ^text;
       enter filename[]
       do ...
       #);

  To use this library you must set the environment variable
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows:

  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /users/beta/X11/Xpm/lib
