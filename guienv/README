This is the first release of uienv.

There is a number of features that are not yet implemented.

The following patterns are not implemented:

*************
* uienv.bet *
*************

The virtuals printDocument, startApplication, openDocument are not called at
any time, since there currently is no standard way to ask the an application to
print or open a document.

onIdle, printDocument, startApplication, openDocument does not have "event" as
prefix, because "event" is declared in the context of interfaceObject.


menu
----
  Popup is not implemented, because this functionality is not readily avaible
in motif/Xt. There normal way to handle popumenues in motif/Xt is to create a
popupmenu for a specific object - for instance a button or the contents of a
window, which is then handled automatically by the system.
--

dynamicMenu
-----------
  dynamicMenu is subject to a redesign.
--

**************
* raster.bet *
**************
raster
-----
  The getpixel attribute are not implemented in any of the subClasses, but this
  is just a matter of getting the work done.
--

bitmap
------
  writeToPBMfile is not implemented, because it will take some time to do so.
--

graymap, compressedPixmap
-------------------------
  These classes are not implemented and it will take som time to do it.
--

pixMap
-----
  these methods are not implemented because they are difficult to implement
sufficiently efficient:

  writeToPPMfile,readFromPPMfile, writeToX11file,readFromX11file
--

****************
* controls.bet *
****************
control
------
  Autohilite is not implemented - the user feedback can not be turned off. It
is a nonesimple thing to override the default behaviour of objects in Xt.
--

iconButton, menuButton
----------------------
  These classes are not implemented yet, because they are not standard motif
objects. It has to be decided how there appearence should be.
--

defaultButton
-------------
  This pattern is not implemented, but should be implemented soon.
--

******************
* stddialogs.bet *
******************

These patterns are not implemented because the implementor had forgotten about
them:

noteUser
alertUser
fileSelectionDialog

****************
* graphics.bet *
****************

Color and rasters used for filling and stippling in drawing operations are not
implemented. This means the figureitems are not fully working. This will take
some time to get right.

*****************
* graphmath.bet *
*****************

Region is not implemented - but should be implemented soon.

**************
* fields.bet *
**************

pictureField is not implemented, because there is no picture object on X -
maybe this should be replaced by "rasterField".

movieField is not implemented, there is no implementation of movies/animations
on X.

textField
  isOneStyle, setOneSize, setOneFont, setOneFace, setOneStyle,
  scanTextWithStyle are not implemented, because there is no styled textfield
  available for motif
