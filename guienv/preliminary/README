Guienv/preliminary: what is this?
---------------------------------

This directory contains a number of *preliminary* libraries, which may
 or may not later become actual utility libraries for GuiEnv.

The libraries are undocumented, may have cumbersome interfaces, and
will in some cases only run on a subset of the platforms GuiEnv
otherwise support.

These are provided AS IS in the hope that they may be useful despite
their incompleteness.

In case someone makes an improved version of one or more of these
libraries, please mail the changes to support@mjolner.com.

editSheet/ 
    Rectangular sheet of cells a la spreadsheet. The cells display a
    text, which can be edited when clicked on.
    Implementation somewhat inefficient, but implemented for all 
    platforms.
    See editSheet/useEditSheet.bet for a demo.
    See editSheet/editsheet.png for appearance.

listView/    
    Sheet of columns, which are sorted according to the active header.
    Native win32 implementation - not implemented for X11 or macintosh.
    See listView/uselistview.bet for a demo.
    See listView/listview.png for appearance.

resources/ 
    Interface to native win32 ICO and BMP application-resources.

imageList/   
    Utility library used to maintain a list of images and image-masks.
    Used by, e.g. listView.
    Win32 specific - not implemented for UNIX or Macintosh

tabStops/    
    An effort to add tab-key sequencing to fields.
    Will be built into guienv itself in the next release.

treeView/
    a native win32 implementation of a treeview.
    Completely different from the one in guienv/utils: 
    Runs only on windows, but has more facilities than
    the one in guienv/utils.

    See treeView/treeview.png for appearance.
