Changed implementation of prompts:
	- Corrected error in 'father' settings for the buttons - was
	  visible on Linux and HPUX9MC (buttons were not displayed in the
	  prompt itself in some cases)
	- Made prompts react to <cr> as OK, and <esc> as CANCEL.
	- Protected the implementation against multiple invocations of the ok,
	  etc. virtuals in the case of double-click,etc. on the buttons.
	- Changed the default positioning in the case of father[]=NONE to be
	  center of the screen (previous version used mouseposition, resulting
	  in 'chasing' of multiple dialogs.

There are a number of modifications in the motif implementation:

* Changes in graphics_unixbody

   - drawRaster is modified to call XCopyArea instead of XCopyPlane,
     this means that the depth of the pixmap must be the same as the
     screen, therefore readFromX11File is changed in raster_unixbody.

     The clipmask is used, if there is any (Xpm format only).

* Changes in raster_unixbody

   - readFromX11File is modified to read the bitmap into a pixmap with
     the same depth as the screen.

* Changes in fields_unixbody

   - To avoid segmentation fault the result of all 

        XmValue -> getPointerResource

     calls are checked.
