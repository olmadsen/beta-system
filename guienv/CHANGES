   6/2 96. Henry Michael Lassen

There are a number of modifications in the motif implementation:

* Changes in graphics_unixbody

   - drawRaster is modified to call XCopyArea instead of XCopyPlane,
     this means that the depth of the pixmap must be the same as the
     screen, therefore readFromX11File is changed in raster_unixbody.

     The clipmask is used, if there is any (Xpm format only).

* Changes in raster_unixbody

   - readFromX11File is modified to read the bitmap into a pixmap with
     the same depth as the screen.

* Changes in fields_unixbody

   - To avoid segmentation fault the result of all 

        XmValue -> getPointerResource

     calls are checked.
