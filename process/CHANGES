Tried to fix process problem (no output from subprograms under Mjølner by
introducing new booleans in private part of process that control
whether the parent process should (after fork) close one or the other
end of the pipe (the end it doesn't need - to ensure an EOF is received
when the child closes its end).

Doesn't quite work, but better than status quo.  API change may be needed.
