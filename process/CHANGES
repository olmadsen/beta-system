More fixes to process.  Fixed activate.bet demo so it should work including
pipe to sendmail (commented out to avoid mail to me).   Set FD_CLOEXEC flag
on pipe ends to improve end-of-file detection.

----------------------------------
Tried to fix process problem (no output from subprograms under Mjølner by
introducing new booleans in private part of process that control
whether the parent process should (after fork) close one or the other
end of the pipe (the end it doesn't need - to ensure an EOF is received
when the child closes its end).

It now works, but it is impossible to have two processes write into the
same pipe.  This isn't very often a very useful thing to do, so it
doesn't matter, but it someone complains we could put in a way for the
user to control the pipeIntoParent flag.
