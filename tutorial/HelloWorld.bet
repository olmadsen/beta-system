    *  =======================            
    *   Author: J.Vaucher
    *
    *   Purpose: 
    *    This is the simplest program possible.
    *    Being able to compile and run it shows that the
    *    compiler exists and that PATHS and ALIASES have been 
    *    correctly set.  It also brings out "meta-programming" 
    *    considerations like the "fragment" system.
