Updated usage of scanIncludes after making it more effecient (changing
changes to its interface too).

OLM: 1.12.96:	Added corrections originally made in betaast/v5.2/index.bet to
		store an additional filed, returnOff together with originOff in
		the same 32-bit integer field.
		After this betaast/v5.2 should now be obsolete.
 

PA: 26.2.97:	Made the same corrections in originOff calculations in
		betasematt (!)
