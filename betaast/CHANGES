OLM: 31/07/2003: Modified use of new binfile.getLongRep with ref2rep
		 references to extend resulting repetition to the
		 size of the enter repetition 
		 - introduced lib:attributes getLongRep

PA:  23/06/03:  Replaced old TOS primitives with new %-primitives

OLM: 06/04/03:  Included betacfl.bet with Visitor design pattern.

OLM: 1.12.96:	Added corrections originally made in betaast/v5.2/index.bet to
		store an additional field, returnOff together with originOff in
		the same 32-bit integer field.
		After this betaast/v5.2 should now be obsolete.
 

PA: 26.2.97:	Made the same corrections in originOff calculations in
		betasematt (!)

JLK: Fri Jul 18 00:26:16 MET DST 1997

Updated usage of scanIncludes after making it more effecient (changing
changes to its interface too).

OLM: 10.2.98:	Introduced pattern onForThis

OLM: 2.6.98:	Changed ASTindex to be a subpattern of AST from 
		mps/astlevel.bet. This will make the relations between
		AST and ASTindex more clear. The attributes inx and
		frag from ASTindex have been removed; instead the ones
		inherited form ASt are used. 

OLM: 27/7/99:	Added MakeMsgList to produce html list of
		error messages and warnings.

ESS: Tue Aug  5 16:42:19 MET DST 1999

Added ScanForSpecialChars in scanBetaText.bet.
ScanForSpecialChars is a variant of ScanBeta.
This pattern is used by the prettyprinter in order to prettyprint the
special characters \n \ooo etc. And to prettyprint concatenated strings
like 'Hello ' 'World'.


OLM: 5/12/99:	Changed semanticerrortext to be an astinterfacellib
		attribute. Added slot errMsg to handle dynamically
		generated error messages.

OLM: 12/12/99:	Moved slot errMsg to astPrivate.

OLM: 12/10/00:	Clean-up in index.bet; moved beta semantic operations to
		betasemops.bet; moved getbinding to mps/utils/getbinding.bet

OLM: 19/10/00:	Created files newindex.bet and newbetasemops.bet to experiment
		with a new version of AStindex that instead of using
		(index,frag[]) to represent an AST-node, wraps a  node:
		theAST: ^AST.
		newindex.bet, and newbetasemops.bet can be used by changing
		include in compiler/CONTROL/system.bet.
		Various changes were needed in the compiler to obtain
		complete transparency between the old and new representation
		of ASTindex.

OLM: 01/01/01:	Made addPrefix and adjustForm subpatterns of protect 
		to catch astOverflow.
