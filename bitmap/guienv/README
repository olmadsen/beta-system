Not all the icons in this home directory are source files in the real
sense.  Many of them are generated with the 'shrink' script (runs on
Linux).

Order is significant

*.png       Nonsource
*.bmp       Nonsource
M_icon.jpg  Source
tv-*        Nonsource
*-pic.xpm   Source
*-text.xpm  Source
*-shadow*   Nonsource
*-small*    Nonsource
*.xpm       Source

bmp files are no longer used.  xpms are no longer used at runtime.

If you add new files, make sure the binary files (png) are added with
cvs add -kb filename
