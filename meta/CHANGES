OLM: 17/6/97:	ListZero problem should not be fixed as described in OLM/26/1/97;
		instead a fix has been made in bobs.bet and astparser.bet

OLM: 27/1/97:	OLM:26/1/97 reversed due to problems with metagrammar.

OLM: 26/1/97:	Change in makebobs.bet; BobsListZero originally wrote a 0 (zero)
		as the production label. This confused the pretty printer, which
		could not PP listZero productionsin certain situations.
		BobsListZero now write a non-zero production value in the
		same way as a BobsListOne.

JLK: 18/6/96:	Merged v4.10 changed into v5.1 (were somehow absent in v5.0.1).

JLK: 16/6/96:  	Created v5.1.

		basiclib/v1.5 based version.

		Converted to new fragment syntax

		Converted to simple-if

OLM: 21/8/95:	Changes to generation of BOBS input; all terminals must now be
		enclosed in quotes. A new BOBS metasymbol 5 defines the
		quote character, which by default is ".

		makebobs has been changed to generate this new grammar format.

		A new version of the bobs parser generator has been made to
		handle the new input grammar format: bobsgen/v1.4.

		The format for communicating labels from bobs to tabc has been
		modified: a dot (.) is inserted between the label and the
		production number. This will allow terminal symbols to contain
		digits.

OLM: 28/8/95:	The gen checker has not allowed digits in nonterminals.
		The reason was the tabc-bobs interface, which could not handle
		this. The BOBS generator has no problems with digits
		in nonterminals.

		With the modfied tabc-BOBS interface described in OLM: 21/8/95,
		there is no problems with digits in nonterminals. The gen
		checker test has therefore been removed.

OLM: 28/9/95:	Fixed problme with splitOnFiles as reported from Dortmund;
		1st file is now foo1.bet and lastfile foocfl.bet, and
		the origin chain should be correct.

OLM: 28/9/95:	Fixed minor problem with blanks in stringChar
