Current bugs and inconveniences.

Bugs
----

Do not edit any files with external editors while they are open in Sif.
If the the tools:Check or Tools:Compile command is used inside Sif than this restriction 
is extended to the whole dependency graph.
However the Edit:"External Textedit" can be used to activate external editors
in textediting mode. See the manual.


Inconveniences
--------------

Sometimes the contents of the codeeditor needs to be refreshed.
Especially after textediting. Use the View:Reprettyprint command.

When following semantic links, the destination node is not shown in the window
but often it is located in line just below the last line of the window.
Use the scrollbar.
