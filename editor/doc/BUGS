Current bugs and inconveniences.

Bugs
----

Do not edit any files with external editors while they are open in Sif.
If the the Tools:Check or Tools:Compile command is used inside Sif then 
this restriction is extended to the whole dependency graph.
However the Edit:"External Textedit" can be used to activate external editors
in textediting mode. See the manual.


Inconveniences
--------------

Sometimes the contents of the codeeditor needs to be refreshed.
Especially after textediting. Use the View:Reprettyprint command.
