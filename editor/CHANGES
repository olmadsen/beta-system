v5.0.2(1)

15/3-96: 

Fixed the bug: 
insert new fragment form when fragment list is empty
=>ref is none

Fixed the bug: 
copy root in one property editor and paste in another one
=> ref is none              

22/3-96:

Fixed the bug: 
following semantic links into a fragment that is not checked may 
lead to an indexerror in indextonode in valuetoast in getnodeattribute in 
dclRef. 
temporary fixed by binding the exceptions of indextonode, in a local copy of
the above operation (codeeditorbody)

v5.0.2(2) (version number was made 9/4-96)

27/3-96:

Fixed the bug:
recovery was not offered on fragment groups without fragmentforms

Added Search/Replace in the Edit menu of the property editor

1/4-96:

Fixed the bug:
When opening the second codeeditor on the same fragment form, 
and the ff has been changed in the first editor, the user is asked
whether to recover from the autosave file

Moved the groupFileMenu.open and performMenu.open to sif, 
in this way other tools like Frigg and Freja, can insert their 
own commands together with Sifs.
Take a copy these open bindings and adjust them.
This may be done differently in the future.
The same is done in siflight, compsif and usersif.

Added the following notifications to be used by Frigg:

ymersiflib.bet, fragmentBrowser:

     onAboutToCloseGroup:<
       (# fg: ^astInterface.fragmentGroup;
          OKtoClose,askSave: @boolean
            (* if OKtoClose the groupEditor is closed.
             * if askSave the user is prompted whether to save the group
             * else it is just saved (if necessary)
             *)
       enter fg[]
       do true->OKtoClose->askSave;
          INNER
       exit (OKtoClose,askSave)
       #);
     onGroupSaved:<
       (# fg: ^astInterface.fragmentGroup;
       enter fg[]
       do
          INNER
       #);
     onGroupCompiled:<
       (# fg: ^astInterface.fragmentGroup;
          OK: @boolean (* OK means no errors *)
       enter (fg[],OK)
       do
          INNER
       #);
     onGroupChecked:<
       (# fg: ^astInterface.fragmentGroup;
          OK: @boolean (* OK means no errors *)
       enter (fg[],OK)
       do
          INNER
       #);

2/4-96:

added onGroupClosed in ymersiflib (fragmentBrowser), 
which is called when sif closes a groupeditor

     onGroupClosed:<
       (# fg: ^astInterface.fragmentGroup
       enter fg[]
       do INNER
       #);

9/4-96:

cvs commit and install v5.0.2(2)

10/4-96:

Fixed the bug: Revert textediting does not reinstall the mps default 
error reporter. This gives problems during property editing.
Solution: a ref. to mps.errorReporter is kept in edenv.mpsErrorReporter.
After Revert textediting mps.errorReporter is reinstalled.

Fixed the bug: opening the property editor on an empty property list
crashes.

Fixed the bug: crashed when reopening a propertyeditor that was closed
via the System menu.

Fixed the bug: when entering an empty file name in the New dialogs the
editor crashed

Fixed the bug: when pressing a key in an empty siftexteditor the editor
crashes in onbeforechange
