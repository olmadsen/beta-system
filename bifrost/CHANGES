As of v2.2, r4.1, the following changed were introduced:
========================================================

The (never implemented) attributes "within" and "intersects" 
of various shapes and graphical objects have been removed.

As of v2.1, r4.0.2, the following changed were introduced:
=========================================================

First implementation for Windows is now included.
Only known Windows specific problem is native (i.e.
non-postscript) print from bdraw, which does not work.

As of version 2.1 the following changes were introduced:
=======================================================

Upgraded to be based on basiclib/v1.5.

Renamed private/Rubber/CenteredRubberRectWithArc.bet
to private/Rubber/CenteredRubberRectArc.bet


As of version 2.0 the following changes were introduced:
=======================================================

Version 2.0 is the first version, in which Bifrost has been 
integrated with the graphical user interface toolkit Lidskjalv.
Therefore a lot of changes have been introduced, that are NOT
compatible with previous versions of Bifrost. The following 
is a short survey of the changes:

1. Fragments.

   Previously the interface to Bifrost consisted of several fragments.
   Now only the following files are present:
  
     Bifrost		Contains all the major patterns for Bifrost.
			Corresponds to the fragment named bifrost in previous
			releases.
     ColorNames		Contains patterns for a lot of useful
			SolidColors
     Palette		A special Canvas, that presents a set of
			graphical objects, and performs an action,
			when the mouse is clicked on one of them
     PredefinedGO	A lot of predefined graphical objects
     RasterGrays	Used to simulate gray tones on a B&W device.

2. Application skelleton

   Previously a bifrost application looked like this:

     ORIGIN '~beta/bifrost/vx.x/bifrost';
     --program: descriptor--
     bifrost
       (# application::<
            (# myCanvas: @Canvas(# ... #)
      	       ...
            do myCanvas.init;
               myCanvas.open;
            #)
       #)

    Now it will look like this:

     ORIGIN '~beta/bifrost/vx.x/bifrost';
     --program: descriptor--
     bifrost
       (# myCanvas: @Canvas(# ... #)
      	  ...
       do myCanvas.open
       #)

    or, if you are using bifrost as a library in a guienv
    application:

     ORIGIN '~beta/guienv/vx.x/guienv';
     INCLUDE '~beta/bifrost/vx.x/Bifrost';
     --program: descriptor--
     guienv
       (# myCanvas: @Canvas(# ... #)
      	  ...
       do myCanvas.open
       #)

3. Changes to the Canvas pattern.

   a) The init pattern has been removed.
      If you want to do something at creation time, the 
      virtual "create" in the "open" pattern can be further-
      bound. 
   b) Event handling.
      The patterns for event handling has been renamed as such:

      onButtonPress 	--> eventhandler.onMouseDown
      onKeyPress 	--> eventhandler.onKeyDown
      onOpen	 	--> eventhandler.onOpen

4. "Current Canvas" notation eliminated.

    Several operations in previous versions of Bifrost worked on
    what was called "the current canvas".
    This was confusing, since it was not always possible to tell
    for certain what Canvas was the current one.
    Instead some operations now require an explicit Canvas entered
    to perform the operation on.

    These are (private attributes not listed):

	Segment.drawRubberBand
	AbstractShape.containsPoint
	AbstractShape.hiliteDesc
	AbstractShape.interactiveCreate
	AbstractShape.interactiveCombine
	AbstractShape.interactiveReshape
	Paint.fillShape
	Paint.fillLine
	Paint.fillMultiLine
	Paint.fillText
	Paint.fillPie
	Paint.fillArc
	Paint.fillRect
	Paint.fillEllipse
	Paint.fillOther
	AbstractGraphicalObject.draw
	AbstractGraphicalObject.erase
	AbstractGraphicalObject.hilite
	AbstractGraphicalObject.unhilite
	AbstractGraphicalObject.interactiveCreateShape
	AbstractGraphicalObject.interactiveCombineShape
	AbstractGraphicalObject.interactiveReshape
	AbstractGraphicalObject.interactiveMove
	AbstractGraphicalObject.interactiveScale
	AbstractGraphicalObject.interactiveRotate
	AbstractGraphicalObject.containspoint
	Picture.firstContaining
	Picture.lastContaining

5. Stopping the application

   Previously "stop" was used. As of version 2.0, the guienv pattern
   "terminate" should be used.

6. Visibility
   
   The concepts of Bifrost are declared in the attributes-slot called
   BifrostAttributes, defined in the window-pattern of guienv.
   This means that e.g. the SolidColor pattern is an attribute 
   of window, in which BifrostCanvas is also declared.
   That is, 

     bifrost
       (# color: @SolidColor ... #)
 
   is not possible, but

     bifrost
       (# w: @window
           (# c: @BifrostCanvas
              (# color: @SolidColor ... #)
           #)
       #)

   and 

     guienv
       (# w: @window
           (# color: @SolidColor ... #)
       #)

   are possible.

7. Changes to Palette

   The Palette pattern has been changed too:
   In previous releases the Palette contained an instance
   of Canvas. In v2.0 it has been made a specialization of
   BifrostCanvas. The changes for Canvas mentioned in item 3 above
   thus applies for Palette too.
   The shiftmodified attribut has been removed. Use
   eventhandler.omMouseDown.shiftmodified instead.

8. ConstrainPicture.
   The file ConstrainPicture.bet has been renamed to SelectionPicture.bet,
   and the (never implemented) constraint attributes removed.

9. Changes to AbstractGraphicalObject
   The (never implemented) attributes rotateTo and scaleTo have been removed.


As of version 1.8 the following changes were introduced:
=======================================================

1) INCLUDE fragments have been replaced by INCLUDE properties.

2) Fragment *group* syntax ( [[ and ]] ) has been removed

3) Dopart slots have been introduced whereever possible to
   improve efficiency.
