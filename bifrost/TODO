1) Find all occurrences of "error!" and try if the compiler can handle them.

2) Maybe problem with first event in sequence under motif.

4) Implement IntegerList (if needed)

5) Implement all patterns marked with "(* Not Yet Implemented *)"

7) Use ObjectPool for PathHandler

8) Eliminate more descriptor-slots by using QUA and computed remote.
   E.g. all copy operations.
   Fake for-loops can also be used to allocate an integer
   in a dopart slot.

9) bdraw bugs:
   
   - Cut, Clear, Delete does not work.

10) In readpbmfile: Furtherbind binary::<trueobject if RAWBITS.
    However, since whitespace is ignored, it is probably not needed.

11) complete "design.bet": Make a HierachicalGraphicalObject.

12) Opgrade the animation package.
