tcsh> interfacebuilder [projectname]

Manual: Not available yet.

Getting started:

  First you need to create a project.

  A project is contains a projectfile (<projectname>.pro), a
  resourcefile (<projectname>.res) containing information about
  the userinterface, and a collection of sourcefiles (.ast)
  containing betacode.

  Creating a project: 

    - Make an empty project directory, ``cd'' into it and start
      interfacebuilder:

	tcsh> mkdir myprojectdir
	tcsh> cd myprojectdir
	tcsh> interfacebuilder

    - Choose ``New project...'' in the file menu - you will
      then be requested for a projectname. 

      NOTE: If the projectname is illegal (eg. contains space
	    or special characters) the dialog will beep.
.

  Now the interfacebuilder has created the projectfile and the
  resourcefile.

Opening a previously created project:

  The easiest way to open a project is to specify the
  projectname in the commandline:

    tcsh> cd myprojectdir
    tcsh> interfacebuilder myproject

  Another way is the choose ``Open project...'' in the File
  menu - you will then be prompted to select a projectfile via
  a fileselectiondialog.

Working with a project:

  Creating af sourcefile:

     - Choose ``New fragment group...'' in the File menu - you
       will then be prompted to enter a fragmentgroup.

       NOTE: Only alphanumeric characters a accepted - you will
	     hear a ``beep'' if the name is illegal.

  Creating a window:

     - Select the sourcefile where you want the code for the
       window.

     - Select the guienvLib fragment of that sourcefile.

     - Press the ``New window'' button in the button panel.
       You will be prompted for a name for the window (in the code).

Using the generated window:

  - Create a sourcefile (in Sif), that INCLUDEs the sourcefile
    containing the window.

  - Make an instance of the window and call its ``open'' method.


  IMPORTANT: The name of the executable BETA program must be the same
             as the resourcefile (without the extension), and you must
             execute the program standing in the directory that the
             resourcefile resides in - the project directory (this is
             a temporary constraint).
