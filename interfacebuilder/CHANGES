October 24 1997: Michael Lassen

Startet an experiment for the dynamic programming environment project
(DPE): Added three files:

   * groupbox.bet: Implements a standard groupbox as a specilisation
                   of canvas.

   * additional.bet: Implements an editor for groupbox to allow it to
                     be incorporated into frigg.

   * userfrigg.bet: A specialisation of frigg that includes the
                    groupbox.

When this example works well enough, the next step is to do it using
dynamic linking instead.
