Fixed bug in friggapplicationbody.bet that gave QUA error when
creating a window in some situations

**********************************************************************
November 23, 2000: Elmer Sandvad
Fixed the outstanding problem from editor 18/1 00: 
"When a file is readonly, the frag.locked flag is now set to true.
This can be used by e.g. frigg, to avoid editing read only files.
In r5.2, a frag.isReadOnly flag should be made, as well as a
frag.touched flag."

Fixed the bug that made createSourceFile crash. The operation
is elliminated and edenv.createBETAlibrary is used instead.

Startet an experiment for the dynamic programming environment project
(DPE): Added three files:

   * groupbox.bet: Implements a standard groupbox as a specilisation
                   of canvas.

   * additional.bet: Implements an editor for groupbox to allow it to
                     be incorporated into frigg.

   * userfrigg.bet: A specialisation of frigg that includes the
                    groupbox.

When this example works well enough, the next step is to do it using
dynamic linking instead.
