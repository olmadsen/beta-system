<h1> Using Dynamic Compilation in Frigg </h1>

<h2> Goal of the Project </h2>

<p> The aim of the project is to use dynamic compilation in Frigg to
create an environment that is better suited to rapid prototyping.. In
the current environment, the designer uses Frigg and Sif to design the
userinterface, and the program must be executed in order to try it
out. Adjustments to the design cannot be made when running the
program. The user interface can look considerable different when
running the program compared to the look of it in the
interfacebuilder. One reason is that the objects in the
interfacebuilder contains no data, whereas in a typical program there
will be some data in the various fields and tables etc. Furthermore
the objects are dead in the interfacebuilder - there is no
interaction. The buttons do not act as buttons and the scrollbars do
no act as scrollbars etc. Another reason is that the designer might
have added some special objects using the GUIenv library
facilities. The interfacebuilder can not show these object as they
really looks like - instead a placeholder object is used. We want to
use dynamic compilation to narrow this gab between use and design.

<h2> Self and Delphi </h2>

<p> I will briefly compare Frigg to two other environments that
support rapid prototyping: The Self system and the Delphi system.

<p> The Self language is a completely dynamic delegation based
language. This is taken advantage of in the Self environment to allow
the user to modify a running program. The designer sees the effect of
any change immediately. However this is achieved not only via the
inherent dynamicity of the language, but also by incorporating
interfacebuilder facilities into the application framework. All the
graphical user interface objects in Self have editing
capabilities. They can be moved and resized, and they have contextual
popup menues that allow their visual properties to be changed,
ie. colour and font. 

<p> The Delphi system uses the static class based langauge Object
Pascal. In Delphi the program must be compiled before trying it out -
just like in the BETA interfacebuilder. However the Delphi system has
a much more concrete feel to it. This is partly because the system has
a considerably larger library of predefined object, so new kinds of
objects rarely needs to be created. Furthermore Delphi has support for
integrating with a relational database. A database table can be
created and then a tableview (a graphical object) can be connected to
the database table. Then the data in the database will be inserted
into the tableview in the editor. One does not need to compile the
program to get a feel of what it looks like.
