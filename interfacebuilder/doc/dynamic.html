<h1> Using Dynamic Compilation in Frigg </h1>

<h2> Goal of the Project </h2>

<p> The aim of the project is to use dynamic compilation in Frigg to
create an environment that is better suited to rapid prototyping.  In
the current environment, the designer uses Frigg to design the user
interface and Sif to implement the underlying functionality.  The
application must then be compiled and executed in order to try it
out. Adjustments to the design cannot be made when running the
application. Often the application must be tried out to get a more
precise impression of the look and feel of the thing. This means a lot
of shifting back and forth between developing in Frigg and running the
application. This can be quite bothersome, since a lot of action might
be necessary to reach the paticular part of the application that are
beeing worked on. Thus this shifting back and forth slows the whole
development process down. There are several reasons why the
application often needs to be tried out in order to evaluate the user
interface:

<ul>

<li> The objects in the interfacebuilder contains no data, whereas in
a typical application there will be some data in the various fields
and tables etc. This greatly impacts the look of the application.

<li> The objects are dead in the interfacebuilder - there is no
interaction. The buttons do not act as buttons and the scrollbars do
no act as scrollbars etc.

<li> the designer might have added some special objects using the
GUIenv library facilities. The interfacebuilder can not show these
object as they really looks like - instead a placeholder object is
used.

</ul>

<p> We want to use dynamic compilation to narrow this gab between use
and design.

<h2> Self and Delphi </h2>

<p> I will briefly compare Frigg to two other environments that
support rapid prototyping: The Self system and the Delphi system.

<p> The Self language is a completely dynamic delegation based
language. This is taken advantage of in the Self environment to allow
the user to modify a running application. The designer sees the effect of
any change immediately. However this is achieved not only via the
inherent dynamicity of the language, but also by incorporating
interfacebuilder facilities into the application framework. All the
graphical user interface objects in Self have editing
capabilities. They can be moved and resized, and they have contextual
popup menues that allow their visual properties to be changed,
ie. colour and font. 

<p> The Delphi system uses the static class based langauge Object
Pascal. In Delphi the application must be compiled before trying it out -
just like in the BETA interfacebuilder. However the Delphi system has
a much more concrete feel to it. This is partly because the system has
a considerably larger library of predefined object, so new kinds of
objects rarely needs to be created. Furthermore Delphi has support for
integrating with a relational database. A database table can be
created and then a tableview (a graphical object) can be connected to
the database table. Then the data in the database will be inserted
into the tableview in the editor. One does not need to compile the
application to get a feel of what it looks like.
