=====================================

Changes in releae 4.0.1:
------------------------

Wed Dec 11 15:46:31 MET 1996/jlk

Removed extra leave in containerBody.bet

Changes in v1.5:
----------------

Added arrayContainer.delete.

Corrected error in queue.

Changes in v1.4:
----------------

The exception handling have been made more fine-grained, concerning empty
containers.  Many operations have been extended with an empty virtual
exception.  It will be invoked, if (1) the container is empty, when the
operation is invoked, and (2) the empty virtual have been further bound.  If
not further bound, the container exception: emptyContainerError will be invoked
instead.

The operation extended includes:
	list:		tail, preample, delete, deleteBefore, and deleteAfter
	queue:		front
	prioQueue:	front, remove
	stack:		top
	deque:		front, back

Furthermore, the efficiency have been raised in many operations, by removing
unnecessary tests, by utilizing static operations whereever possible, by using
dopart-slots, etc.

Several errors have been removed in e.g. list.splitBefore, list.splitAfter,
etc.

In all files:
-------------
1) INCLUDE fragments have been replaced by INCLUDE properties.

2) Fragment *group* syntax ( [[ and ]] ) has been removed
