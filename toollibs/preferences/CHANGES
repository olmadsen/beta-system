1) Updated to v1.5 of basiclib and sysutils.

2) preferencesDBbody.bet
   a) preferencesSave:
      On windows you cannot rename a file to a name of an already existing 
      file.
      Therefore the following has been added:
      ....
      fTemp: @file;
      do 
        ....
        fileName[] -> fTemp.name;
        (if fTemp.entry.exists and fTemp.entry.writeable then
            fTemp.delete;
        if);

   b) preferencesLoad: and preferencesSave:
      If the last line preference file did not contain a newline character
      load and save failed with a array bounds exceeded (at least on Windows), 
      because f.getline returns nothing if the line does not contain a newline 
      character. 
      Therefore after:
      f.getline->line[]; 
      something special is done if line.length=0.
