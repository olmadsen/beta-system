  LOGBRUSH.

  - Changed bytesize of TEXTMETRIC from 53 to 56, which is the correct value 
    (TEXTMETRIC was/is not used).
  - Fixed EnumFontFamilies.

- wingdiconsts.bet: Added some new constants and structs.

- winuserconsts.bet: Added some new constants.


A lot of UNIX inspired attibutes has been removed from NTFile
