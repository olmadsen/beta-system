.SH AVAILABILITY
The Mjolner  Integrated Development Environment is available as part of the Mjolner System from Mjolner Informatics.
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mjolner
is a general structure editor, especially targeted for browsing and
editing BETA programs.
.I Mjolner
contains a number of basic components: a source browser, a fragment
group editor and a fragment form editor.  
.I Mjolner
is integrated with the BETA compiler
.I beta (1).
This integration gives a good support for locating and correcting
semantic errors.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.I (none)

.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.I mjolner
recognizes the environment variable $BETALIB. Please note
that this variable is given default value in the Bourne Shell
script 
.I $BETALIB/configuration/env.sh
.TP
.B BETALIB
Specifies where 
.I ~beta
is located.  If not set,
.I beta
is assumed to be a username, and 
.I ~beta
being the home directory of that user.  Is used by many tools in the Mjolner
System.
.TP
.B EDITOR
If specified, simple textediting (as opposed to structure editing) can
be done using the text editor, specified by 
.B EDITOR. 
Simple textediting is activated using the 'External textedit'
command of the Edit menu of
.I mjolner. 
After textediting, the modified text is parsed according to the
corresponding syntactic category.  E.g 
.I emacs (1)
can be used by setting
.B EDITOR 
to
.I /usr/local/bin/emacsclient 
and starting
.I emacs 
as a server by
.I emacs -f server-start.
